21,2,"I love the app and in my opinion it’s better than tik tok but there is something crucial about this app. Everybody loves Snapchat and likes to make jokes but the lock system is so messed up it’s attacking it’s self. The main way to meet strangers is through “Quick Add” but if you use it to many times your account gets locked then told it’s because of spam. I had an account that I had the idea to get as many friends as I could on Snapchat but it was struck down by Snapchat for as you guessed it, spam. So I kept unlocking my account thinking it was just a fluke happening a lot to me but the last time I did it they locked up my account and threw away the key. I met so many good people on Snapchat and now I have to start over on a clean slate just because of “spam” which I didn’t even do. And their excuse for it is “ we’re sorry that some accounts get locked “. What the heck kind of excuse is that for getting everything ripped away from you. As much as I love the app the thing that kills me is it locks up innocent accounts and let’s the spammers go away scot free. I really need you to fix this because while the auto lock attacks the innocent the spammers actually get away and bypass it. All I’m asking is you give me my account back and fix the system because it is really messed up. That’s all I have to say.",1/25/21 4:17,0.2484444444444445,0.4955555555555555,trust
34,3,I mean I like snap and all and I use it a lot it’s just been messing up my phone a bit. So you see whenever I open Snapchat it’s gets kinda glitchy and I don’t like that when I open it and exit and then re open it and go into my camera roll on snap it won’t let me select more pictures and videos until i exit and clear it from my data and have to re open the app and it’s just a pain so yeah and the new update I mean it’s okay kinda annoying I liked the original snap and I mean it’s not that bad there’s some things better like it’s easier to hack to do screenshots with out the other person knowing oh that’s another thing I don’t like that it lets the other person know you took a screenshot of there snap or chat it’s just annoying because than they ask why and you have to make up some excuse but another thing is whenever I try to send a video to someone from like Tik tok to snap if it’s over 11 seconds it’s won’t let me and then I have to save the vid to my camera roll and do that whole exiting entering thing I was saying earlier. But over all i use snap a lot and I like it there’s just a few things that could be done differently. Thank you snap chat and have a good day everyone!! ☺️,1/21/21 3:33,0.006954545454545453,0.5366818181818183,positive
46,3,"I’ve used snap for a few years and have never had as bad issues before. It constantly lags when I first open it, and chats wont show up constantly, and it often says I left someone on opened but I had sent a message back to them, it’s getting really annoying having to apologize to my friends for the stupidest stuff, like maybe fix your bugs and issues before trying to copy tiktok. I personally do not use tiktok because of how toxic the community is, and now I keep seeing everything copy that god for saken app, Instagram has done the same thing. Literally everything on the snap reels or whatever is just stuff shared from tiktok. And don’t get me started in the ads on the stories, I get when you’re looking through friends stories, you can just skip those, but the stories from anything else is HORRIBLE. Every 5 seconds there’s a 5 second ad! The stories aren’t even worth looking at anymore because of how many ads are in them! Snapchat has honestly just become terrible, I only use it anymore because I talk to so many people on it, and I don’t wanna lose my streaks. If you are thinking about getting this app, don’t. It’s not worth it.",1/27/21 20:45,-0.07875000000000001,0.4345833333333333,positive
57,3,"I love Snapchat and I use it every single day then you’re probably like “ well why did you put 3 stars” here’s why... Few times here recently I had to logout to let someone else login and when I logged back in most of my recents had disappeared. They’re still my friends but their name doesn’t show up. I have to go and search for them to message. A few people even just added me and sent me snaps I didn’t get the chance to open them and their name and snap disappeared it’s like they had never even snapped me. Again I love snap it’s honestly the only app I use but this is really becoming a pain. I have never had a problem with logging out and logging in until here recently. Also, my snap score isn’t going up it goes up on mine but if I have someone look at my snap score it’s like 60,000 lower than what mine says. I know a lot of people have been having problems with the snap score the past few weeks. I’m also not getting any Snapchat notifications and I only know when someone snaps me if I go on Snapchat. It doesn’t show any new one’s and after a few minutes they just appear.

I got sooooooooooooo mad I couldn’t even think straight that morning, all of my pics and videos, GONE!!!!!!!!

105,3,"I’ve had Snapchat for 3 maybe 4 years now and never had any issues with it. In fact, it’s one of two ways I keep in touch with pretty much everyone I know and now that it’s glitching out and crashing constantly, it’s really getting annoying. I never had any of these issues with the crashing until a week or two ago and it really makes me want to use it less and less the more it happens. It’s always right when I open the app, it crashes, or when I take a picture, the app crashes and the picture I took is gone. I thought it was because of other apps I could be using like Pandora or discord but even when I’m not using something else it still happens constantly. It’s to the point that I can’t send streaks or post anything on my story because every time I take a picture it crashes. Every. Time. This doesn’t happen to any other apps on my phone, so I know it has to just be Snapchat.

But last night I noticed that after I added two new people tryna be my friend in snap all my Snapchat friends names were they’re users names . So I clicked on the names and it said “add friend” so I did and I added a majority of my friends back and when I started adding some more is wouldn’t let me add people anymore . I tried to click a couple times and it just won’t let me add .... it’s aggregating cause I looked up why and it said something like “ it’s probably because you have to much people on there “ which couldn’t be it cause I see people on my Snapchat who have over 1.1k viewers and all that . My viewers are around 190 and that’s it , and a lot of those people are close friends that i don’t necessarily talk to a lot so I’m just confused . Is there any possibility of letting me be able to add all my friends back . Cause I love the app but if it’s gonna be a problem I’ll just delete the app and use something else.

188,2,"I used to love this app but now is a different story. I would check my phone when I got a Snapchat notification from one of my friends. I would click on the notification and there would be no snap there. This has been happening for the past two weeks now. Today I got in and I started to snap my friends. My snaps wouldn’t go through but my messages would?? I tried turning off my WiFi and that didn’t work, then I turned it back on and turned off my cellular data and that didn’t work. I was not the only one that this happened to. I asked on my story if this was happening and it went through. This has happened to over 10 of my friends for the past few days. Snapchat has been glitching so much and messing up snaps. I used to love this app, but since the outline of the app changed— so did the quality on a lot of it.

Update: 
I deleted the app and reinstalled it to try to fix the problem. I reinstalled the app and it won’t let me in unless I verify with a phone number that I don’t use anymore or an email that I don’t use anymore 😡😡😡😡😡😡",1/11/20 0:25,0.05555555555555555,0.4000000000000001,positive
199,1,"I’ve been using snap for about 7 years; had MULTIPLE memories as well. And I have never had my account getting locked like this continuously. My snap account has been getting locked for no reason, I have a verified email and phone number too, and didn’t add people that much, nor did I do bad things on my accounts. When my snap account got perm locked for the first time I was heartbroken, memories gone to waste 😡😡. So I made another account, and another account, every account I made got perm locked in less than a week. This was my 7th snap account and I was starting to feel like snap wouldn’t bother me anymore, perm locking my account for no reason. But it turns out this one got perm locked as well 😐. Honestly you guys should start fixing this glitch before other snap users like me quit Snapchat, it’s bad for your app. Snap bots that scam people don’t get perm locked, but I do? Clearly, this is a glitch and I would like my account back.

Snapchat would probably never do this because of the ad revenue, but I seriously want to be able to turn off the Snapchat discover feature and the new spotlight TikTok page or whatever. They’re great features, but they’re addictive time wasters. I have ADHD and I’m really trying to better myself and limit my social media use to help, so I deleted a lot of my apps like Tiktok. I use Snapchat a lot to communicate with friends, but now it’s basically just like TikTok and I can’t avoid it. If I had kids with the same issue I’d be frustrated that I can’t control their screen time or content with this feature. I know there’s a hide feature but the discover stories  just go on and on with no way to hide them all. Can you PLEASE set a parental control option to hide or be able to control these features? I like and joined Snapchat for its fun form of communication, not to be spammed with ads and content that I don’t want.

You guys should also add chains like cross chains or regular chains ,gold chains ,silver chains. like we should be able to select what chains and what color. Also you guys should also add more to chose from like the beanies. You can only chose 2 types of beanies and there aren’t many colors options. you guys should add more color options Also more type of beanies like ski mask beanies which is the one with the whole in the middle when you roll it up. You guys should also add more options for cloths like ripped jeans and etc. but I really feel a lot of people would like if you gave us a variety of accessories like diamonds earrings and gold chains or cuban links.

Snapchat Is one of the few apps that can get away with glitches that may leave if unusable for hours at a time. What glitches you may ask, there is all kinds.

Any time someone opens a message and doesn’t respond, the next time I open the app it says the message was “just opened” and only adds time from there. Messages take too long to send, and make a conversation feel like it’s dragging with the slowness (even on a new phone.) Snap Maps is rarely correct, marking me far away from where I am or saying someone was on 4 hours ago that I am actively messaging at the time.

433,3,ok so i lost some of my memories and I’m so so mad right now. Like why can’t Snapchat have a update that every memory we save just backs up automatically. That’s way we won’t have to worry about logging out and having 50+ snaps to back up before logging out. I am honestly so MAD right now. I didn’t have time to back up my memories. And I’ve tried to clear my memory cache and see if I can get them back but it doesn’t work. And I also would like for Snapchat to give back all my memories that I just lost. As well for everyone else. Because I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one with the issue of losing memories every now and then.

First it’s telling me that I have no friends added which is not true because I have over 1k people added second it wouldn’t even let me send my streaks.

461,1,"I’ve been using Snapchat since 2016 and it’s given me a few problems here and there, but just recently, it’s banned my account for no reason. I didn’t violate any of the TOS. I’m hoping that I wasn’t hacked and I certainly doubt it, but if I was, why do I get punished? I got logged out and attempted to log back in, only to discover I’ve been banned. I reached out to the stupid, robotic customer service and it told me my account has been terminated and removed the databases. It’s ridiculous how you can’t appeal for a ban lift and automatically get sent a robotic message, even when sending a detailed message. Not to mention, they won’t let you make a new one. How cute.

I did not share any information to anyone about my account so I have no idea how it could of gotten hacked especially with a password I had, which was very long and difficult. Now I had Snapchat for over 6 years & it was great with the many funny filters & memories I had created along the way, but all those are gone because I got hacked. Now even though my mistake was that I didn’t backup my memories Snapchat into a computer or my camera roll , snap did not do anything possible to help me out to at least try to get my account back or memories. They also still have the account up and running even though it was reported a bunch of times !

The “you may know” tab should be like, people that often go to the same place as you, and about the same times too. Helpful for students to get to meet people, or coworkers, or gym goers, wherever you commonly go. Secondly, I’d like a survey option, where someone can post a survey on their story that people can answer with the click of a button instead of answering yolo’s that someone has to count. Maybe an option to see your friends friends that you may know/like. Obviously, there’s gonna need to be a setting to turn off that one and the first one though.

512,2,"I made snapchat in 2016 , and it was really fun. The app was changed several times but it wasn’t problem for me. The real problem is that you can not protect your account from hackers or others. 
When I deactivated my account once, someone else used my e-mail address and snapchat let that person use the app despite the e-mail wasn’t verified by me! I got an e-mail with the instruction of confirmation, and I declined because I thought it was a mistake, but after sometime, my snapchat friends announced me that someone else is using my profile.
After that I had to take back my account, and to change password to protect my privacy. But two weeks ago snapchat support just shut down my account without explanation, and again same thing is happening, and my account is used by someone else, and receiving the confirmation e-mails etc. 
Snapchat team, I need you to fix it, it is inappropriate.",1/3/20 13:31,0.06574074074074075,0.15231481481481482,trust

2) Snapchat needs to update the ability to go live, like on Facebook and Instagram. This is a very fun feature and would allow users to feel and be more connected to their audiences. Please update this.

3) DONT SELL OUT TO FACEBOOK!!!

With my new phone (iPhone 11), when I talk for too long, it shows that it is no longer recording, but when I release the microphone to send the clip, it is deleted. I’m not sure how long the allowed time is, but let’s say it’s five minutes- that’s five minutes of information and conversation that is lost and I now need to re-record.

But other than those things the app is absolutely awesome and so fun I use it at least 5 hours a day .

This feature was on my phone for a day this week then went away so I was happy but now it’s back for some reason. Go back to the normal picture/video taking option.

613,2,"From a social aspect this app is decent. You take pictures of yourself in a moment and send them to your friends who in turn send pictures back. You can chat with them and send pictures over chat. One aspect I don’t like though is the snap map. In the pictures on the App Store, they make it look like it’s some fun way to see where you’re friends are. However anyone that has the app can agree that people only use it to stalk their friends and other people they have on snap. It can often make people become jealous if they see that their friends are somewhere that they are not. Also on the snap map, you are able to see when the last time one of your friends was on snapchat. Overall, the app is ok but wouldn’t recommend to kids under 13. This app can become highly addictive fast so watch out. This is being written by 14 year old so just a heads up.",1/11/20 14:28,0.12884615384615386,0.4,positive

968,3,"Snapchat is a very fun and useful app. However, I wish the Snapchat support team would be more helpful and interactive, rather than distant until they make an annoying update. 

  I’m going to put it simply. I am a very controversial person (not disrespectful, just controversial) and I’ve been reported on Snapchat for no other reason than that people disagree with me. Annoying, yes, but it is what it is. 

  However, when Snapchat informed me that I had been reported, it was the worst communication of information I have ever seen.

  “What behavior?” You ask.

  We don’t know! Because Snapchat either 

1) didn’t view the report 
or
2) didn’t care enough to tell me

  Neither are great for snapchat. Furthermore, I have not once violated Snapchat’s guidelines. It doesn’t necessarily hurt my feelings, but I am rather that Snapchat would allow a report to go unseen or neglect to investigate it (or even simply tell me what I have been reported for).

  Overall, it’s a great app, but I am disgusted with the lack of involvement with the support team.",1/21/20 22:19,0.04302631578947369,0.6009022556390978,negative

Normally I would blame Apple for this issue, but my volume shutter works fine using Apple’s camera app. Developers create apps to suite devices and their changes. This has gone on for long enough. If I have to use your app to take the pictures make sure the app actually works.

For almost 2weeks now I have been constantly sending support tickets asking no begging for them to fix the issues and there was slipstream another version released 3 days ago and nothing is fixed. Let make a list of everything that’s either has disappeared or just quit working.
1. None of my posts are being views in Our stories. And I have a creator account so that fundamentally important. 

2. I no longer have access to spotlight, which is also important to a creator account. 

3. I’m at around 4K subscribers plus the 5k that’s comes with the account but it still only says 5k subscribers when it should say 9k

4. It will not let me update my billing info so I can’t make any in app purchases like promoting my art for my business.

5. I’m supposed to be using lens from the lens studio and there is no lens studio in my settings where it should be. 

6. Nobody no matter how many times I send out support tickets do they ever respond.

It would be for the best if you didn’t know you screen shot because everyone uses this to text call so much more so here’s a scenario what if someone threatened someone or talked about shooting someone and you screenshot as proof and it tells them then they are going to get mad and could possibly hurt them so I think maybe it not telling them you sxreen shot would be the best.

I also wish there were less silly games and more filters for snaps. The newer updates that include so many silly games takes away from the fun of the app, IMO.

My biggest complains is this latest version doesn’t allow me to rotate text orientation using “classic” text. It’s so irritating.

I don’t have my screen orientation on lock, and it’s been months, so restarting and updating doesn’t fix it.  I haven’t been able to rotate text since September or maybe even August.

Sadly, I don’t have dark mode? It’s not like I have an old phone, I have an iPhone XR. My friend with an 11 has it, so I’m just wondering why it’s not available for me yet. I’ll figure it out eventually. 

Anyways. Here are some suggestions I hope you’ll take into consideration! 

1. Customizing the filters / lenses that are available to you in your main lens bar. (For lack of a better term). Im really happy that you can now favorite filters so you can save them for later! However Snapchat is always giving me useless ones that I don’t need. I understand some are for advertising purposes, but I should be allowed to delete and add lenses to my bar. I don’t care about turning myself into a baby or making my face look silly. I use Snapchat to take cute pictures. So I think it just makes sense. 

2. Searching sounds. Come on. I really don’t understand why this isn’t an available feature. I don’t feel like scrolling through tons of sounds just to find the right one. I know it’s a relatively new feature, but having a search function would be nice.

Also I know plenty of people that will start typing something and never send a message because they do it as a way to get someone’s attention passive-aggressively. #2 when someone sends me a message, there are times when I click the notification and no message pops up on my screen at all when the app launches and I’m not able to see anything unless the “save for 24 hours” option is on, so please take this review into consideration.

196,5,"I only have one comment and it’s that with new iPhones and some older generations they give you the access to put dark mode on which in turn turns every app black why is that Snapchat is the only app on the App Store that I know of that when you turn on dark mode the screen still bright white. Some other users have said that they have access to dark mode which is not fair orAnd a little biased because you give big-time influencers and craters the option to have dark mode but people like us they still use Snapchat on a day-to-day basis are still waiting to use that feature.
One more complaint is that we all should have the option to have our profiles like some creators where you have your picture and different highlights so then if someone wants to add you looking for see what you look like and be able to choose different things on it.",2/5/21 4:28,0.023693181818181818,0.5010606060606061,sadness
197,1,"Customer service on Snapchat is extremely terrible as everyone probably already knows, and I know it runs worldwide and it could be hard for them but you would think if that were the case they would just not make the app at all? Recently, I kept getting locked out of my Snapchat account that I had for over a year, so many friends I had on there and snap scores and streaks going and a lot of people I couldn’t get back. It’s very upsetting that this happened to me considering they didn’t notify me before hand that I would eventually be PERMANENTLY locked after but they didn’t. With that being said, since customer service on snap is horrible and from what online says, I’m not doing anything wrong...

I need to know what I can do to fix it because I’ve had to make three new accounts so far and they all keep getting permanently locked at this point I’m ready to just delete this app if there is nothing you can do for me.

It’s very irritating that I can’t just communicate normally without getting locked 3-4 times a day, and I have spoken with many other people who are getting irritated. So what’s going on?",2/11/21 19:40,-0.11002020202020206,0.5980808080808081,negative

I didn’t use any third party apps nor send anything inappropriate, and followed the steps listed in both email and twitter. After waiting a couple weeks I tried to log in again but I would be kicked out. I made over 5 different accounts in hopes to start over and reach snapchat, since the locked accounts only received generated messages no matter what I said. But I’ve been able to log into my account on different devices, and contacted apple about maybe being my phone. Apple reached back and said it was an error for snapchat to fix. It’s been over 2 months, almost three, without access to my original account and I cannot use the new accounts. Snapchat needs better support besides generated messages and what is listed on the website. I lost years worth of memories and contacts permanently without any warning nor help. Do not recommend.

227,4,"I wrote a review about Snapchat’s status with phones around a month ago, very harshly critiquing their lack of support for new phones upon their release.  It seems I wasn’t the only one to share this issue, but it seems they listened.  My poor review mostly critiqued the fashion which pictures would be taken using an indirect method (burner) for rear, and front facing camera shots.  Now, it seems they’re using all of Apple’s tools for active photo editing and I can often see when I’m flipping between cameras quickly that it will sense a face and apply filters to enhance the face upon the background creating depth and proper color.  Many other issues I seem to have been having such as my Snapchat’s failing to refresh has also disappeared.  While I am still not happy that an application of this magnitude and outreach still has so many fundamental issues, but I applaud Snap Inc. for the measures they are taking to treat them.",2/10/21 17:13,0.050104895104895096,0.5799650349650349,positive
266,1,there’s no doubt that I absolutely love using Snapchat to snap with friends and family. But there is a minor problem that I feel like could be easily fixed to fix snapchat and to better the user experience. When you get Snapchat you usually add friends but when I started adding friends I started getting locked out of my account due to the spam and I understand that there should be a precaution on spam because it could be a robot and we don’t like robots spamming other people and all that but maybe instead of locking you out of your account and then permanently locking you out of your account after three unlocks you can maybe do it like Tiktok how they say oh you cannot like this post for a while because you like too many post too quickly or you cannot follow for a while because you’ve been following to quickly. and due to the permanent locks I have lost contact to some friends which angers me. If Snapchat could fix this this would be perfect this would make the app way better thank you and I hope Snapchat sees this.,2/5/21 22:27,0.22083333333333335,0.42678571428571427,trust

It made a lot of things laggy and some bugs that they still haven’t worked out. Recently it’s been crashing like crazy, it happens about every 5-10 snaps and it gets really annoying. The app uses too much battery, and ram. Whenever I try to send mass snaps (Like a blank snap with an s on it{streaks}) it gets very laggy and takes about 2-3 seconds for it to register that I tapped on someone’s name, and in addition to that some of them don’t send and it has a very laggy scrolling animation.

428,1,"If you know anything about IOS, the OS does a great job of letting you know what has access to what. 

Setting aside the fact millions of Snapchat users are unknowingly sharing their location with everyone they've added as friends, Snapchat is now requiring that your precise location be shared with Snapchat to use what they’re calling geo-filters.

My ""precise location"" should not be required for me to use a ""Wichita"" filter or thumb thru the possible locations around me. With precise location disabled, Snapchat gets an idea of my general area, not the address of my home.

Snapchat has demonstrated significant disregard to user privacy and continues to find ways to limit users who are trying to protect their critical data - such as their location.

This platform has been great, and I’ve been happy to use it and enjoy it; however, data mining my location and ushering me into allowing privacy settings to be more loose by unnecessarily disabling a huge portion of the app is totally wrong.

Apple gives us production users the ability to fight back against the privacy issues that all of these apps we download introduce, and Snapchat just crossed the line.

Fix it, and I’ll be right back to being a happy Snapchatter, but until then - care about user privacy, and listen to these reviews.

She has years worth of memories saved onto that account she would like access to. I mean I can’t believe you guys don’t have a call center or someone to reach out to besides via email. She has like 5 ticket numbers. Why are you so slow with replying? My other friend got her account hacked by the same person and she was emailed back instantly and got her account back within a few hours. There’s just no consistency. She shouldn’t have to remake an account after having one for almost 5 years. And not to mention you guys locked her account on her because someone was hacking it. Which yes that’s awesome, but you aren’t helping her unlock it. Literally get it together Snapchat.

876,4,I just literally have one question for you guys. You have such a big platform and you have a huge number of users. Why do you guys allow ads that are more than 95 percent aren’t useful? Why show ads about car insurance going from 1000 to 50 dollars? Why show ads about student loans being forgiven and credit scores are just going up so easily? Or people are making money so easily? These are such falsified ads! If things were that easy we wouldn’t have to work hard for anything. A lot of the contents you guys show about celebrities are honestly unnecessary  and useless but it’s ok because a lot of teenagers like to know these things but those ads are absolutely unnecessary and falsified.,2/19/20 18:43,0.10059523809523811,0.574404761904762,trust

I have sent them many emails in regards of the issue that is occurring for me. And I have not received one helpful email in response. I further in my information and saw this was happening to many other people like myself. They were locked out of their account and prohibited to create a new one.

910,5,So I’ve had snap chat for about a year and let me just say it’s really fun! I love pretty much everything about it and it’s my most used app on my phone. I do have a few suggestions though. The first thing is can you please add comment sections on spotlight?? Another thing is that if I’m in a group chat and I block someone in the group chat I can still see there messages so please fix that another thing is that sometimes a person will be able to text me even if I haven’t friended them. So please can you fix these issues? Other than those few things it’s a really great app and one of America’s most popular apps,2/28/21 21:08,0.3038461538461538,0.47564102564102567,positive
936,1,As I entered 2021 I decided I no longer wanted to follow as many people on social media so I got rid of everyone on my Snapchat friend list except for three people. THE ABSOLUTE RAGE I HAVE OVER THE CONVERSATION SIDE OF MY SCREEN BEING FULL OF QUICK ADD PEOPLE IS INSANE! I mean these are complete strangers that are being recommended to me because I’ve hidden everyone I know already because I figured if I hid people from quick add then the list wouldn’t be there. Instead it doesn’t matter how many people I hide. I kept this app for the ability to enjoy my news and the memories I’ve got saved in the app. Please delete this feature as it’s not needed. I don’t need friends on the app to enjoy it.

It’s fine if you have news on the discover feature, but most of the content that is seen in the discover feature is pretty stupid to say the least. I love how you can talk to people from around the world with the video chat feature and it works better than zoom. Also the creative potential with this app is insane. I think if things could be changed it should be to get rid of the discover feature for people who don’t want news in the first place.

Spotlight is fine, but a great way to improve it is to make editing a snap more smoother so people won’t make them in other apps.

So it makes it hard to show the entirety of what I am trying to show on Snapchat. (I paint cars for a living & share each project on snap, so seeing the whole video is important)

But one thing that blows my mind is how many bugs there are. a handful of sound issues, and for an app that lets u send one time messages/pics/videos, that is a major issue. they’ve been super innovative over the years with what they have added and have excelled at that but when you look at the basics it’s not even mid. it’s sub par.

On one occasion, I wanted to share a song with a friend and thought I could do so using the music button. However, I quickly realized you can only share or play featured or mood music, which was a massive let down. What, then, is the point of that button if it can’t perform the most basic function we’d expect of it? Users should be able to search and select music on Snapchat in much the same way that they can on Instagram story. It’s the only reason why a music button should even exist.

Chat redesign.  I think it would make the app much better to have a more traditional chat interface, with message bubbles and things like that.  I’d definitely use it more!
Along those lines I’d like to maybe see separate subpages or sections on the chat list app to organize by text chats and picture chats.

This is going on the third day that I am unable to send any Snapchat‘s I have now lost all of my streaks all of the Snapchat‘s are still trying to send from three days ago I am not the only one experiencing this problem it’s not a service issue because I can go anywhere and it still won’t send. I have deleted the app and re-downloaded it that did not work I have logged out and log back in that did not work I have messaged them multiple times and nothing has happened I’m honestly getting very upset with Snapchat.,2/3/21 23:14,0.04285714285714286,0.3857142857142857,negative
3346,1,So I had the iPhone 8 before I got the iPhone 11 Pro Max and so when I would take pictures with my old phone the pictures would come out nice and clear with flash. Now that I try to do the same with my new phone the pictures look blurry shaky and grainy. I thought it was just with flash but it also is without the flash. Furthermore the pictures look good before the actual picture is taken because after it looks like there is way to much light. And I know it isn’t my phone as I could take beautiful pictures through my camera app and other apps as well. Snapchat please fix this issue.,2/3/20 6:21,0.2207300275482094,0.49435261707988976,positive

2.chats and friends 
3.adding ppl
4.using a lot of filters 
5.adding to my story daily 
As u can see i use basically every feature on this app but i just for some reason CANT make a bitmoji
Since this is the only social media my mother lets me have i spend most of my time after school on this app. I don’t know if it’s just me but 1 thing l would change would be to add a search section where we could search shows not just ppl

6756,2,Hi Snapchat! So as I’ve learned that there are new features to the app... you added new mini games that you can play with your friends!! I have been really hooked on thus game called sling racers!! You added that to your mini games. It’s fun and all but you updates the mini game to have ads every single time I press next race.. all I’m asking is for you to maybe add less ads. Because it can be really boring waiting for an ad to go by without a skip button...,2/20/21 16:38,-0.14136634199134201,0.3390043290043291,negative

since adding the shows and the “for you” feature, it seems like my friends stories are 2nd to all of the other stories of people i don’t know or random mock clickbait stories. 

i would love it if snapchat have a page for all of my friends stories and then put all of the other stories and tv shows in different pages. i go on snapchat to see what other people are doing and sometimes i just get so distracted. there’s simply way to much going on.

hopefully you take this into consideration, thanks

1.) Support for recording in “4K at 60 fps” **PLEASE** and sending high resolution videos in DM as well
2.) Change fonts in messages 
3.) Have new filters everyday

I could make a new password if I could ACTUALLY GET IN SNAPCHAT. Please fix this thank you :) also I don’t understand these bug fixes because it’s never helped my Snapchat not once.

And with the screen I updated my phone for it I restarted my phone and I’m scared to delete the app with some reviews I read about us not downloading it again? Please fix Snapchat and let us change our names and give us dark mode. And stop locking people out of accounts! That’s happened to me three times and for what? I’ve been on Snapchat for years no one deserves that stuff because then you have to start all over again and it’s annoying it really is.

Also when I open the app after I got a notification, the Snapchat will not appear. The most annoying bug is when the Snapchat says, “Tap to Load” but when I tap it won’t load and I’ll never see the Snapchat.

I’ve tried restarting my phone, deleting the app and download it again, I've logged in on another phone, I’ve cleared the conversation, and I’ve cleared my cache but nothing seems to work. Another thing, it is very hard to reach Snapchat. I had to really work to find how to reach them and tell them about their bug and I feel like it needs to be a little easier.

47,4,"I personally love this app and it’s a great way to text and chat and do lots of things on honestly! I have a few issues with it though. One is that when I go to a chat and press the smile face I can’t find the cutout thing to make a cameo. I’ve been looking left and right how to. I’ve been asking my friends and everything they tell me is not showing up on my screen. For example they said to update Snapchat and then maybe I’ll see the cutout so I updated it and honestly nothing changed. I can’t find how to make a cameo. My friend has even sent me a link to Snapchat support saying how to make a cameo but I am missing on of those steps. I don’t have the face cut out image on the bottom of my bar when I press the face. I have one more issue. The only snap game that I can’t play is Bitmoji party. Me and my friends are always trying to play bitmoji party together and hers works and mine doesn’t. Everytime I try playing, before I even start the game, it says connection lost. EVERY TIME! So I would love if you could fix the bitmoji party and I know that it is not my connection because I have strong connection.

82,1,"This app has an array of glitches. I haven’t encountered many of them but the one that plages me is it not delivering snaps from me to other people. It’ll read delivered on my end but my friends will have never even seen a notification for it. Snap are disappearing and it leaves the sender to only wonder if the receiver is ignoring them, when on the other end they are shown left on read. Me and my ex best friend where on some rocky roads and this glitch was the last straw. Trying to work out our problems where hindered by this glitch and now things have gotten so bad that she didn’t even consider me a friend. Because friends wouldn’t leave them on read on never text them right. Well I did... or at least I tried but it never got to her. But she doesn’t believe me and my best friend of 5 years has drifted out of my life. The little things like sending your friend a hey every once in a while or a video showing a dumb thing happening right then is of huge importance to show how often you think of them,  take these away and you can destroy an already crumbling friendship... but do them and fix it. I tried but Snapchat ruined it for me and she’s out of my reach now. Thanks a lot and please fix this glitch",3/17/20 3:43,0.0810515873015873,0.40304232804232804,positive
107,5,"I love the app, it’s good for communicating with fiends, weather it be through a chat or a snap with funny filters or a group chat! The group chats are amazing, no doubt about it, it’s helpful and it’s got a lot of interactivity, but one thing that could be helpful for a lot of people, is the option to mute a group chat without having to get on the app or on settings. What I mean with this is that sometimes people are busy on their phones or have something important and can’t get off what they’re doing to mute a group chat or go to settings. So....if you could implement an option where we could slide down on the notification of a group chat and mute it without having to get off what we’re doing at the moment, and whenever we get on the app to check the messages, the option of muting could disable automatically, or just have the option to mute it for a certain amount of time, but over all, the app is good, I love it and it’s fun! 😊🙂",3/9/19 3:03,0.3278108465608465,0.6123181216931217,positive

Small thing but I’ll mention it... when sending videos from memories it now tells the person it’s from memories and the date... that’s a new feature that would have been nice to be notified of lol.

130,5,"Hi Snapchat! This is an amazing app, and awesome for texting your friends. I’ve had this app for years now. But I feel like you should consider adding a few new things. First off I would like to consider being able to pin more than 3 people, I just feel like sometimes it’s hard to pick who you want to have at the top when there’s only a small number opinion. Second off I think being able to customize/ make your own bestfriend list would be really cool and helpful. I think this would be helpful  because if you end up not texting someone anymore and they are far along in your list it’s hard to get them off. I just think it would be a very useful feature to be added! Last but not lease I think considering a dark, or black mode to Snapchat would be really cool! Once again this is an amazing app already and very fun to use but I would just like to to consider adding these features.

But there are many issues with the app. For example, the Snapchat map used to be to see where your friends were, what they’re up to, and also seeing what people around the world are doing. Now it’s just people advertising their Snapchat accounts for views. The whole idea of Snapchat was to make a social media platform that doesn’t have like feature to prevent bullying. Now people only care about views, which really don’t matter at all. The explore feature has become a way for liberal companies spread their ideas everywhere and seeing what the latest celebrities are doing. Who cares! And the worst part of Snapchat is the streaks feature. It is completely useless. It is essentially a way to brag about your terrible Snapchat addiction to your friends. I personally don’t do streaks, and for some reason I get shamed by people for not?

164,3,"I hardly use Snapchat anymore because it’s no longer fun. The public stories are no longer from around the world or themed and showcasing funny strangers. Instead they’re of celebrity’s lives or magazine posts you can get anywhere- if Snapchat needs to share those to make money, then at least still keep (and most promote) what made Snapchat so special to begin with-it’s celebration of culture and life’s authentic moments. Also, all of the Snapchat-created filters are now about looking sexy, but in a twisted, demeaning, and socially corrosive way that interprets sexy as also making you look like a 12 year old girl. Where are the funny filters, the themed filters, that you could actually utilize to make a good story with? Snapchat’s estimation of their audience has clearly degraded. That, or they think users want out of Snapchat what users want out of Instagram- to share their best looking moments and follow the ‘best looking’ experiences. But Snapchat is a different platform, of course we want a different use out of it. Stop interpreting your audience as one dimensional.",3/14/19 22:06,0.23803854875283445,0.5323696145124716,positive

I can always just close out of the app and enter it again and it’s fine. However...a good idea (in my opinion) would be to have the option to separate memories into different folders. Like stuff you want to easily access quickly instead of having to scroll through by date looking through hundreds or thousands of snaps. For example, one folder would be snaps from fun times with friends, or another would be times during a certain activity, like for me it would be marching band season and band trips. It would be so much more organized and easier to access memories to show people quickly so you don’t have to sit there forever trying to find it, or even if you’re just looking through old memories and want a good laugh at some fun times you had.

I normally don't write reviews but I'm hoping this could help some younger children be aloud to get the app. As one of those children who wasn't aloud to get the app, I see no reason why. Not just anyone can see your story or chat with you. They can send friend request but you can easily deny them. When you post a story, you can also change who has access to your story and you can checkout the viewers. The stories are HARMLESS as long as you use them wisely for younger snapchatter's. The thing about location and the snap map. You do NOT have to turn on your location to get the full Snapchat experience. Although if you want to add a color filter over your video, location is required but honestly, the color filters aren't as wonderful they may seem so you can DEFINITELY go without them.

Snapchat does not care about your safety security or privacy. If you are hacked the best thing you can do is have everyone you know report your account multiple times every day until your account is deleted.

They worry about the post being permanent, and that they made a mistake. Facebook, and Instagram and apps that have the like feature on it is the most associated with insecurities. This app is perfect in that those who only use Snapchat and others like it do not worry about their “popularity as much”.

But your filters are really nice and you have a lot of options, matter of a fact I might change it to three stars. Also note that we tried everything, to shutting down the phone and uninstalling the app.  At this point we don’t know what to do.  

I would really appreciate it if you can get back to me.❤️❤️❤️",3/22/20 0:23,0.0741019214703425,0.4293200951095687,positive

One thing I strongly disagree with is the camera for the Iphone XS, XR, and XS max. I’m very disappointed about how it looks grainy and zoomed in on these certain phones. When will you fix it Snapchat? I’m sure many people are confused and disgusted about it. Apple and Snapchat should work together to fix the gross zoomed in camera and grainy look. Also the flash is very poor. It’s not very bright and doesn’t give that flash look that the iphone 7+ and Iphone 8+ flash gives. When I first got my Iphone XS I was especially excited to use my snapchat and the flash on it and camera quality. Since snapchat is one of my daily uses I would really appreciate it if Snapchat could fix it’s camera quality. Thank you.",3/24/19 2:24,0.0833362251783304,0.5840720390720391,positive

It is really uncomfortable knowing someone could be stalking what you sent to them when you don’t even know it. I find it very unsettling. Especially if for example you use bad language and they could just screenshot and use against you without even knowing it. And I know you guys probably don’t find this important but I really do.

Another thing I would like to point out is that I can get notifications before the app recognises I have a snap and lets me load it. I would like this to be instantaneous and not me waiting a while.

542,3,"i used to love snapchat. it was my favorite app to use to talk to my friends, and it honestly still is. but there has always been an issue ever since you guys did the complete redesign update like 2 years ago. these days, my snaps don’t load, sometimes they don’t send, stories take really long to post and sometimes people can’t see them and i can’t delete them, my memories take forever to load and i have to close the app and reopen it a bunch of times for things to work. and on top of this, when i close the app and reopen it, i can see that people’s stories are there, but the circles are just white and when i tap on them nothing happens, and when i swipe to my snaps, there is the search bar where it normally is but none of my snaps are there the screen is just white, and my bitmoji isn’t in the top left, there’s just a yellow person. none of these issues ever happened before that big update, that was just a bad idea like everyone said it was at the time. 

almost all of your updates have included bug fixes, but honestly snapchat, how many bug fixes do you need to do for it to actually be fixed? it’s getting really really annoying. 

instagram never has these stupid issues, and when they do, they fix it right away.",3/31/20 22:21,0.09928571428571434,0.4876190476190477,positive

I was making a sticker of a youtuber meme and he was wearing a black hat, (which was the main part of the meme) and the background was black. The outline drawing thing didn’t pick it up and I was kinda mad bc I wanted it and couldn’t do it.

A few minors tweaks would be great, though.

 (1) I have the iPhone XS, and anytime I’m using the camera to take a selfie, the camera is super zoomed in. I feel like this could be considered a bug, especially since it wasn’t like this at all in my iPhone 8. 

(2) I would love it if the My Eyes Only section could include folders. That way it’s just a little more organized. 

(3) The new way of viewing stories is great! The little icons by my friends’ names make it so easy to keep up to date, but I feel like some more organization with the Discovery area would be great. Maybe separate my subscribed shows from the ones I don’t really watch. I know there’s a section for that, but it would be a lot nicer if my subscriptions and friends had their own section separated from discovery entirely, like a separate page.. 

(4) Favoriting filters. Some of my favorite filters come and then leave a couple days later.

1.You should add a costume button for the skins bc, for my skin tone I can’t find a tone that quite matches my skin tone.
2.I have vitiligo (where your skin pigmentations are destroyed and cause white patches to spread around your entire body) so I think u should add a button where we can costume our own skin to look somewhat alike your real skin.

Connections: 
1.I think snap should be offline. I think this because I personally can’t call my mother on phone because it just goes to message, I struggle with this because I have after school activities where I would need to call my mom to pick me up but because I cant call here one phone I would have to go to my cousins house and wait for my mom to pick me up from there. That’s a problem because my mother has other children at the house that she will need to leave home alone to pick me up.

733,3,"I’ve had snapchat for about two years now and while it is my main platform for communication, there are somethings I would like to be added. Some include...

1. Changing our usernames!
I think everyone wants this, the majority of us made our usernames when we were younger or maybe going through a phase and now that we have matured and such we probably just want it too be our first and last name. Of course some people don’t but I do think this would be a great feature. Maybe limit the times we can change it? That way you can still find a person quite easily.

2. Profile pictures
While bitmojis are cool and all I feel as if they don’t say much about the person. Profile pictures might be hard to see so maybe you could have the choice between picture or bitmoji.

3. Spotlight
Spotlights just blah you know. Nothing too special, so maybe to improve it you could see how many likes there are, have comment sections, and be able to download videos.

4. Live
A live option could be cool. It’s not very creative but it would be a nice feature. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this :) hopefully you agree with the majority of these!",3/29/21 21:43,0.25812812187812184,0.5211996336996337,positive

Then it tild me to verify it but it wouldn’t let me click it on my computer. I meant to log into that email on my phone the next day but i forgot. I never got any kind of warning saying that my account would be temporarily locked. Then i was chatting with a friend and it loofed me out and it said temporarily. I go to rte support page to see why i was banned and later saw that not verifying my email was a cause to this. I immediately rushed to my mail and logged into a different account and did the verification. But its been hours and i still cant get in. So i would like to first see a warning before this happens and a way to verify off of computer.,3/23/21 22:12,0.2642857142857143,0.41904761904761906,trust

I would like to say that my granddaughters laugh at this app however they are 12 and 13 years old. I am not impressed at all I try to monitor their online activities and Snapchat is not very friendly when it comes to seeing what your children are doing. Maybe I am missing something and if so please educate me. My granddaughters are excepting chats from people they have no idea who they are. At this point I have completely taken their phones away from them and have no plans of returning them back to them. Snapchat allows anyone to sign up , this most certainly is true since every grandchild that I have under the age of 18 is signed up for this app also it does not allow a parent to go in and review the snaps because they disappear once the kids erase them,I don’t think it is a very friendly child format or a parrot for a mat for that matter",3/24/21 6:02,0.09932692307692308,0.3934615384615384,positive

I have been locked out of my account for over 24 hours even though it says temporary lock. I looked over every possible reason why my account could be locked and I haven’t done anything of those things, but can I reach out to customer support to try and resolve the issue?

If Snapchat is going to throw that many ads in my face they should at least make them all skippable.

I have to leave the app to actually stop it. 

 With chats, when I send them, I press to save them and they save, but they glitch and I can’t see the half the sentence, it like cuts in half until someone else sends something. Just fixing the memories and bug fixes would be fine.",3/21/20 0:30,0.09791666666666668,0.3125,positive

I have had Snapchat for a long while now and I love the app so so soooo much!! And please I don’t want anybody to be offended it is your own opinion and you do you.😇😁so 1.

Can we block out cuss words because I once had a really toxic friend and they were cussing me out and I really didn’t like it so I don’t really think we should be able to do that because really young young spoiled spoiled little like     3-5 year old can get Snapchat and act like there 15 or 20 years old and there actually 3-4-5 and I hate it.

1553,3,"Since the past several updates, I’ve noticed that it now takes longer to save chats (one single tap of the message saves it). When I do this now, there is a long delay in which it shows that you saved the message. 

It’s annoying due to the fact that I save all messages regardless. Thus, it won’t save and I can’t leave the chat until I see the message is shaded (indicating that it was saved). 

In fact, the delay is so long and misleading that I end up tapping the message a second time because it either is 1) too slow that I believe that it didn’t save thus it unsaves it directly after it saves or 2) I tap the message to save it and I patiently wait for it to save just to find out that the lag is so slow that it never even processed the the tap in which I was attempting to save the message. 

Suggestion:

1) Create an option to save messages indefinitely and not just 24 hrs 

2) Fix the processing lag between tapping the message and Snapchat actually saving the message

I’ve never written a review for an app before and love Snapchat, but after just one day with this it’s brought me to the point where I feel that this needs to be fixed and is ruining my overall experience with the app. I really just want to know if and when this problem is going to be fixed, thank you.",3/22/19 2:37,0.11111111111111113,0.4666666666666667,fear
1863,2,"I’ve had Snapchat for a long time. I enjoy being able to share pictures and videos with my close family and friends. However, I also really enjoy the Snapchat stories. The problem is the amount of ads I’m forced to watch in order to watch the videos. I’d understand one per story but I have to sit through an ad every two slides. I’d like to be able to either skip them all together or just watch one ad in the beginning rather than 10-15 throughout one video. They get very annoying. I hope Snapchat sees this and takes this into consideration on their next update. I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels this way about all those ads.",3/31/21 5:06,0.095,0.5738888888888889,anticipation

I’ve been receiving notifications but no messages. I had been snapping just fine right before this. I turned on airplane mode and then back off to see if that would reconnect. Instead the screen wouldn’t even load back up. I offloaded the app not wanting to lose the data and then re-installed the app. Now it won’t even open the app and keep bringing my phone back to home screen when I click on it.

Not only that but it changes the color of when you first initially took the photo, meaning that when I took the photo I had an orange hue that I like from the sun however, snapchat changed the color of my face to a light yellow. Deeper melanin is what I strive for in my photos and I don’t wish for you to change that.

When I download or instal snap chat I have to instal it once then delete then instal again so it can be downloaded because if I don’t twice, it will not be installed. And this annoys me so much!

There have been several times when I try to add people back and the app responds saying “Too many friends” and won’t let me add that person. How can you tell me I have “too many friends”? I’d highly appreciate it if you would let me have all the friends in the world instead of me having to tell people I can’t add them due to my other friends.

1978,1,So to start off this review my Snapchat was hacked by someone without me even knowing until I was logged out and when they got into my account they changed my email and number verifications so I could not change my password. So that caused me to lose my account and snapchat has done nothing to get my old account deleted while whoever hacked it is posting inappropriate story’s for my family and friends to see. Snapchat does not even have a contact number to get in contact with a representative. This is very dangerous and could ruin someone’s life if they were to start to slander the person of who’s account they hacked. All in all terrible customer service and security.

2147,1,"I’ve been a Snapchat user since it first came out. I decided to delete today. Here’s why: 

It’s turned into a dangerous app, especially for our younger generation. It is influencing children and teens in a very negative way about exposure internet safety and screen time. It promotes underage sexual encounters, bad internet security habits, and it spikes dopamine to biochemically keep you coming back. 

Not to mention, you can’t even go through the app without seeing politically motivated adds. It is gross that some people are taking advantage of the fact that Snapchat users are mostly young. These people know that if they influence young people ideologically, they will likely build their lifelong ideological foundation from these encounters.",3/18/19 12:46,-0.05999999999999999,0.4823809523809524,positive

2768,3,i’ve had snapchat for about 5 years now with no problem regarding the app whatsoever. this was until september ish time last year when i started noticing some of my notifications were missing and they didn’t pop up unless i deleted the app or logged out and then back in. sometimes they never came back unless i sent streaks the next day. this is very concerning and frustrating. PLEASE focus on fixing this issue instead of adding little games and useless features to the app which might be causing this mishap.,3/18/20 8:17,-0.12083333333333332,0.22407407407407406,negative

13,3,"There are many bugs and glitches that go on throughout the app. I am not going to list many besides maybe 1-2 because you can look back at the other reviews, but the particular ones that bother me are the chat messages being delayed in sending and the notification one. The notification one: when you first install Snapchat, it asks if you want to allow notifications. Some people would press no, but if you press no, you aren’t able to go back into IPhone settings and change it afterwards. You have to uninstall Snapchat and reinstall, and login again, and it’s just an annoying hassle. Also, the little shows that you can watch are either very boring or very entertaining, but it’s hard to gain motivation to watch them anyway because of the ridiculous amounts of adverts. Like seriously, less then every 30 seconds about 10 second ad pops up. Very annoying. 

Now for what I like about the app. I love all the filters and how you can explore even more filters, and it’s just very fun to use. I also just love the concept of sending little videos and photos to friends, I don’t know why but it’s just very fun.

First; I can not clear an entire conversation column and have to go one by one through the messages to clear them. Also you can’t look up your friends; how is anyone supposed to organize their friends list if we can’t even see who’s our friend without searching them? If you have 20 or so friends you are basically spending 2 minutes of your time trying to clear your snap window. Second; the stories; filled with biased propaganda and absolute garbage. I enjoy subscribing to some of the channels but the fact that most of these channels feature some of the most controversial topics and are completely one sided is unfortunate.

I tried closing the app out wait a few minutes and reopen it and resend my snap, but it still wouldn’t go through.

However, I feel the need to rate SnapChat 1 star because of the number of times my account has gotten locked since I downloaded the app about a month ago. I use a Jailbroken iPhone 11 because I like the freedom of my device and being able to do whatever I want with it without the manufacturer (Apple) preventing me. Jailbreaking is NOT illegal and does NOT mean I’m doing anything that an average user wouldn’t do with SnapChat. I have no tweaks that modify SnapChat in any way. I’ve done the things that SnapChat  recommends to avoid getting my account locked while jailbroken. My account still gets locked at least every week. The fact that SnapChat is so against jailbreaking concerns me as to why they don’t support people having freedom of their device. It makes me think they do shady things. Banning people for wanting their device to be the way they like it is absurd. It’s one thing to ban someone for modifying SnapChat to do things that it wasn’t intended to do but to ban someone for wanting to change the icons on their home screen, change the system font, set a GIF as a wallpaper, or other minor changes is stupid and that’s why I regret downloading this app.",4/7/20 21:19,-0.09531249999999998,0.5434027777777778,negative

I am subscribed to a couple influencers and I have notifications on for two or three of them. I will sometimes be on the app and see that they posted and view their story, and of course, I would view their story so there would really be no need for a notification. Even though this occurs sometimes, I will get a notification five to ten minutes later about the same person, and it would be in regard to the post that I already viewed. Something else that happens with the notifications is that I do not receive them until about fifteen minutes after the post has been up.

58,2,So I’ve had snapchat for almost 4 years now and I’m just getting more and more disappointed. When I first got snapchat I really liked how it looked and the the icon had not such a bold out line. And it was different layout. So I’m not saying that any app should never update itself but think about what people want upadated and make changes to that. Anyway u guys updated the app and the whole layout changed I didn’t really like how it looked at first but I got use to it and then liked it. But then u guys changed the whole layout again this year and I hate it. I’m not against androids but that’s what it looks like and it just looks weird for an app to look like that. So there’s one thing. Then the next problem I’m having is that my friends are Apple to send multiple snaps bc it says on there phone under like the little drop bar down option they have a little multiple photos thing but I don’t. And I would really like to use it but ever since I updated the app I’ve been unable to find it. So I’m not saying I hate this app and would get rid of it but I think that there should be more tests run and maybe do a survey of what people would want changed about the app so they can still enjoy the app.,4/8/20 11:31,0.03279914529914528,0.48354700854700855,negative

You can also pin comments on messages and see who saw you’re story that isn’t your friend, on iPhones. You can’t do that on androids. The discrepancy between both is pretty upsetting. I don’t think people with androids such be left out just because they have different devices. People with androids are missing out on being able to access these features. 
Also the new update is annoying. You’re making it more complicated than it should be. People really don’t care to follow influencers unless they actually like them. If they do, they’ll find them. There’s no reason to have like 2 pages added just to fill them up. I guarantee, people use Snapchat for their friends, not so much celebrities.

They’re corrupting the minds of children who’s awful parents allow them to use it unsupervised. There’s a high level of sexualisation of teenagers with all the clearly underage girls in inappropriate clothing etc. In an attempt to have a modicum of decent content, I’ve “hidden” at least over a hundred stories, with no exaggeration, and it still keeps coming like an endless cesspool. There’s also racist content with shows like “Hello, White people,” where they explain to white people, who never held slaves, how to apologize for slavery, to people who were never slaves. I’ve seen stories where relationships between parent and child are portrayed as “isn’t this a quirky thing goin on, here’s how it happened!” As if it’s not objectively wrong, no matter how it happens.

The “hide” feature is a sad excuse, at your attempt to give people the ability to control content. Please, think about a way to allow users to turn the discover feature off, or seriously curtail and modify the content. Otherwise, this user as I sure as many others, will stop using the app and remove it.  This use to be a good feature back when it was first developed, but now I am afraid to use Snapchat around others.

125,1,"Snapchat was really good at first. It allowed me to connect with family across the globe. It allowed me to get homework help from classmates who’s numbers I don’t have. It allowed me to share memories with others. But in the last two months Snapchat has had so many glitches. It sends me “ghost” notifications that someone snapped me but when I look at my Snapchat no one snapped me. Or I try and send something and it won’t allow me to. It will always say unable to connect but I’m on a very strong WiFi. When I use my data it say the same thing and my data is equally as strong. The worst part is that it’s not just me who’s going through this. Many of my friends aren’t even able to log out of their Snapchat. The app tells them “unable to log out” so if I can’t log out and I also can’t log in what’s the use of the app. Especially in times where we need apps like Snapchat to connect and talk to our friends, what’s the point if we can’t even use it properly. It says that they updated the app on April 6th but it’s already has a new round of bugs that aren’t helping users.

133,5,"So I love Snapchat and I use it all the time everyday. However it is getting somewhat boring and not that fun anymore. However, I love when Easter comes around and we get to collect the eggs all around and see who can get the most. It is always something fun I look forward to do with my best friend and it’s not exactly the same his year but it’s the best it can. So basically I wanted to suggest doing something like this but all the time so basically I think it would be cool to get like badges or award or something to collect when you go to a new place, state, country, or a state park or significant place like Washington monument or mt Rushmore or something. I don’t know I just think adding that would be a cool feature and so you could compare with your friends. And you could see where your friends have traveled too and what badges they have on the snap maps. I think this would spice it up a little and just add to the overall fun usage of the app. Thanks",4/11/20 21:08,0.22625598086124407,0.4318181818181818,positive

It was really frustrating and I lost a new snaps bc of it and it’s okay it was my fault I didn’t back them up but it should t have taken me an hour to get back into my account. I will still continue to use Snapchat but please read this and try to fix whatever makes your app do this.

Also on my backup it says i’m temporarily locked from my account but when i went on their website to unlock it says on there permanently banned on both backups. And i’m just really mad because on the actual app it doesn’t say that just temporarily locked. And it’s disappointing that snap has done this. I’ve literally loved snapchat for the longest time and now there is no way of me getting back to my friends and anything that i had. Just very upsetting.

173,4,"Snapchat, in its nature, kind of opens the fires to toxic people, in the fact that anything anyone says can be instantly deleted by the person without leaving a trace it was ever said. It also can be there opposite, where someone joins a group, or gets added without the rest of the group being okay with it, and now this person won’t go away. The app desperately needs an option to remove people from groups. If not give the option to remove people from groups to the person who started the group, give an option where people can vote/request people out of a group, which would be anonymous. If, say, at least 75% wants a user out, the user is removed. It’s very frustrating having to make new groups without all our saved stuff whenever some random person is added as a joke or something, and then doesn’t leave... Please add a remove feature, ideally as an option to the user that made the group in the first place.",4/19/19 6:01,0.05553030303030304,0.5712121212121212,positive

However I don’t get why you don’t allow us to communicate with other players that aren’t that we play with. Sometimes we really want to talk to people that’s also in game with us. It’s nice meeting new people from across the world. Or at least allow us to have an option to add them. I was playing today and it “seemed” like I made 2 new friends during the breaks because we always take the photos together and dance together on the dance floor and follow each other etc, but there was no way for us to communicate.

One question I have is, why does my location have to be enabled to access the color filters? That’s one question I’ve been wondering for quite some time.
     One suggestion for this app is to have a button to click to send streaks. Anyone who sends streaks daily has to go through and click on everyone who they have a streak with. If there was a “Streaks” button, which  automatically chooses the names of the people the user has a daily streak with, I feel this app would be more convenient.

It is probably my first mode of communication with my friends and I use it to read news articles and look at memes and watch random videos. I don’t think I ever had a problem with it before but lately it’s been kind of buggy. Two main things that I have noticed is that sometimes it says my snap is delivered but my friend never gets it and on their end it says I left them on open. It’s like the snap gets lost. The other thing which I have a huge problem with is that whenever I screenshot anything from a friend it automatically tells my number one best friend that I screenshotted something from them. This is concerning because I’m not actually screenshotting something from them but they are being notified that I am.

Try again.” In all reality this app is just becoming a disappointment after a disappointment. I’m sure Snapchat will just brush this off as another negative feedback and won’t do anything about it bc it shows that thy didn’t do anything about it with the other feedback like mine.

It will also sometimes post out of order and therefore save out of order, which is a hinderance if I want to save the video to my camera roll.

It’s extremely frustrating because I’ve been using snap for a while now and i that’s how I communicate to the majority of my friends that I don’t have other contact information from which is the whole purpose of sc but once you get out of your acc permanently there’s no form of communication. As a result I would just like snap to find a way to include customer service or just help to resolve these problems.,4/26/21 12:47,0.07033799533799533,0.4032634032634033,positive
347,4,"I love Snapchat, it’s my main form of communication.  I use it to communicate with my friends and loved ones from home while I’m at school, including my long distance partner.  We have had the pink hearts (meaning we’ve been each other’s best friends for over 2 months) for a while now.  After a fantastic weekend I made the 3 hour drive back home.  When I went to snap him that I had made it home safe I notice that our pink hearts were gone but he was still MY #1 best friend.  This could only mean one thing, I am no longer his #1 best friend, which means he must be talking to another girl more than me.  This did not sit well with me and I let him know... 24 hours later our pink hearts were back, peace was restored, and I felt like a donkey.  Please, please, please for the sake of this man’s sanity fix the bug issues. Thanks 💕",4/15/20 4:05,0.25895833333333335,0.40479166666666655,positive
348,4,"Snapchat is probably my most-used app and i use it to talk to almost all of my friends. it’s easy to use and it’s not as complex as a lot of other social media platforms. however, there have been a few problems for me. 

i often only respond to the people i actually like talking to, so that leaves me with 50+ notifications at any given time. i like to try to respond to everyone at least once a day though. i individually reply with a snap to each person, so it increases my snap score (as opposed to sending one snap to all of them). when i get about halfway done with responding to all of them, the app crashes. when i reopen it, all the snaps i just opened and responded to come back, and i have to reopen all of them. it doesn’t show that i responded to them, so i don’t know which ones i still need to respond to, so i’m often accidentally double snapping people.

there have also been occasional bugs where it tells me that my friends haven’t responded for days, but they have, and it just doesn’t show me that there is a snap there waiting to be opened.

overall, i recommend snapchat. i just wish there were more bug improvements so i can use the app the way i want to use it. it seems to be only me, as my friends haven’t complained of the same things.",4/14/20 16:57,-0.015196078431372547,0.3308823529411765,trust

352,1,"So Snapchat as been testing different approaches of bypassing Apple’s upcoming privacy rules. Obviously Snap Inc. Does not give a rat’s rear end about people’s privacy, only about making it’s bank account fatter.

Perhaps Snap Inc should move to China.  Shame on you Snap Inc! Please have some decency!

385,3,"I use this app almost everyday, and it is great. My only complaint is that when you find an issue,  hoping to get a solution is pointless. Best hope is to look online and hope someone else is having the same problem and that someone else already found their own solution. Their “customer service” is basically a rabbit hole of Reddit pages coming from people who REALLY should be getting paid for the work they actually put in to try and solve these problems other people find and post about.

That being said, if anyone has a solution to make it so that posting a longer video from your camera roll onto your story DOESN’T require the people viewing your story to tap the screen to proceed to the next section of the video (otherwise that section just repeats), PLEASE let me know.

I am a small content creator and this is such a hassle to try to work around every time I try to post. The way I have to edit everything, its hard to get it to flow as one continuous video.

Basically, I need a way to turn the infinite loop OFF, but the button never appears when I’m posting a video from my camera roll. Do I really have to find a way to make the video only using the camera in the app itself?

I wouldn’t have so much of an issue with this if I was told the reason why my account was locked, and a specific amount of time I’m supposed to wait.

It can be difficult to avoid them, as they are right below my friends stories (the people I actually WANT to hear from) and the way they format the story section makes it almost impossible to avoid them. If Snapchat did something where it separated the friend and discover stories, like you had to swipe left again to get to discover for example, then discover stories would be more bearable.

I also notice that my friends have a white background where you swipe down to see your snap ID or where you go to change your bitmoji and wonder if i dont have the right update.. I am going to update  my phone and see if that helps but if u have any advise that will be great aswell thank you have a nice day",4/23/19 20:02,0.25376984126984126,0.4405753968253968,positive

I tapped on where The bitmoji should have been and it took me to their snap profile which it said to add friend even though I’m already their friend and I’m theirs. So I though maybe if I tried logging out, turning my phone off and on and even Downloading the app again and nothing worked.

When the app started out it was a wonderful way to get in contact with friends by snapping a picture of what you were doing but now they have new stories that are on politics. Ever since I have not seen a positive story about anything on the right side, they are extremely biased. I am not usually one to complain but when I went on Snapchat I found a false story on a trump supporter. Anything that was said in the video only had to do with something bad that she did for example, she parked in the staff parking spot at her high school that she maintained a 4.0 GPA at and they said that when security told her to move she told the principal the president of the leadership group should have they’re own parking spot and the principal agreed. Really?! They dug in her past and thats all they could find 😂 cmon! STOP BEING BIASED!",4/23/19 5:12,0.09062326066790354,0.6030272108843536,positive

662,4,Hey Snapchat you guys should make a social group in Snapchat like if you were playing games online with your friends like PS4 or Xbox and you can see your friends characters online you can talk with them and send them messages. You should make something like that on Snapchat such as you can go to a cub or where you can go as your character and you can see your Snapchat friends characters online too if they’re in the club or social place. And it’ll feel like your actually with them but it’s on Snapchat. So you can see their character and hangout or dance or do something and you can talk to them on the phone or send them a chat through Snapchat. Idk maybe it’s a bad idea but it’s an idea lol but in my point of view that’ll be pretty cool.,4/12/19 20:10,0.09583333333333335,0.46874999999999994,positive

730,1,I’ve been a user for about 5 years. I had 5 years of memories in my Snapchat memories. I’ve broken a few phones so most of the pictures on snap chat I’ll never see again. Pictures and videos of my daughter growing up. My account was hacked by a convincing scam. A bunch of my friends were victims. Snapchat told me my account couldn’t be recovered with MY info. When it was hacked the person changed the security setting to sms verification. I was locked out instantly and have not been helped back in although I contacted them right away. This happened about 3 weeks ago. I keep crying because of what I lost. I’m not saying don’t use Snapchat. Just don’t feel so secure about it. They aren’t helpful. Back up your pictures somewhere else. And even if someone snaps you asking for your personal info NO MATTER WHAT verify it’s them.

753,2,"The messaging portion of Snapchat has obviously become widely popular and is acceptable in all regards. The more recent updates to this app (within the last year) however, seem to focus more on pushing an incredibly biased political agenda and proposed generational atmosphere rather than improving the actual function of the app in any way. The way they’ve implemented this agenda is rather distracting, and it is becoming difficult to navigate the application without learning of a new Kardashian child or seeing another headlining top ten list of why trump is dreadful, alongside scantily dressed women who are ‘recommended for me to follow’ for an unknown reason. These subjects and photos seem out of place and altogether unnecessary, and I feel that with the toxic and negative subjects they are attempting to turn into both popular opinion and interest, we as a generation should cut ties with Snapchat entirely.",4/29/19 13:17,0.09431818181818181,0.5523106060606061,positive

934,1,After 5+ years of using this app out of nowhere my account gets deleted. I’ve been using this app as my main way of staying connected to all of my friends. I used this app to house so many of my most important memories. The amount of time and fun I’ve spent enjoying this incredible. I have never used my account in any wrong way what so ever. I wake up this morning to find an email saying my account is deleted for going against the terms of service. Then they have the audacity to also say I can not make another account. I have zero clue as to why or even how I could’ve broken terms of service. The fact this company also doesn’t have a support email makes this situation even worse. So many memories of my childhood and high school life are now just gone. I’ve always loved this app up until today.,4/28/21 16:06,0.23047619047619047,0.5623809523809524,trust

I thought the update would help, but it only made things worse. I was attempting to send a message through Snapchat and I got logged out of my account and I can’t log back in.

964,1,Snapchat is a good app! I just am very disappointed with the app because it always tell the viewers exactly where you are and what you do with their chat or account. That is one thing I HATE from this app. You guys need to fix that right now because it can get someone hurt. For example just 3 weeks ago I took a screenshot of an account by accident and this girl was telling to “pull up to coffee park” because she was gonna get it on. This is unacceptable! I have had Snapchat for the past 2 years and that is the 20th time that has ever happen. Oh and let’s not forget: when you report someone Snapchat does not give no warning to the other viewer and the viewer still post and does very inappropriate things. I have had it! I give this app 1 star. The only good thing about this app is that you can call your friends. But everything else is stupid!,4/9/20 19:40,-0.05982142857142858,0.5654761904761906,negative

The animals should include dog cat farm animals, types of fish, and some mythical animals for fun. Also if you block someone it should have a little Bitmoji with them in jail.

Most of them are just time fillers for people and fail to entertain/inform/educate.

I know it’s an individual’s choice to look at this content, but it’s obvious that the company is intentionally trying catching the eye of people who do not want to look at the content by making their friend’s stories very small icons at the top and the media stories much larger.

i would also love a way to make a group but without making an actual group. like when i snap a picture i can tap on a button, that i labeled “streaks” and put all the people i have streaks with in, then it would send the snap privately to all the people in that group. it would make sending streaks and other things easier.",4/1/19 18:26,0.19791666666666669,0.4695833333333333,positive

One of your problems is you cannot even hit the exit button to back out of full screen videos because they placed it in the upper left hand corner too close to the phones upper menu tab so it never functions properly. The phone never recognizes you hitting their tiny little x cuz it has to pick up the menu on that part of the screen. Seriously, how do you allow that to happen as a company.

My app always crashes, sometimes when I'm looking for something in my memories it kicks me out of snapchat or takes me back to the camera icon, it un-adds random people, it has said that people have blocked me but they can still text me, and it always says “an error has occurred” every time I try to change my friend emojis in “manage” in the settings. It honestly is starting to get on my nerves. I have deleted and reinstalled the app many times in the past month. I don’t think it helps.

1585,4,"I have been using this app for about a year now and even used it a little bit about 3 years ago. 3 years ago I didn’t use it that often but now I use it almost every minute of the day. For a while I was getting a bug that pretty much doesn’t let me open people’s snaps. And one that doesn’t let me use any features of the app. Other people had similar bugs. Like the typical story post “my snap isn’t working I’m signing off”. If you know you know.

However, I am very pleased with the app as my rating says but, I am very displeased with the amount of bugs it has. And I think Snapchat needs to also add some security because it seems to be easy to get into other people’s accounts. Over all though, the app has been a great help to me over the past year and even helped me make new friends, find old ones, and I even fell in love with a girl I added off of quick add 😂 

I 100% recommend this app to anyone looking to socialize.

•The Games. Me and my friends LOVE playing them together!

•The Original Shows and Stories. They are really entertaining! There’s a lot of things to watch as well!

•Custom Filters. I love checking out all the new custom filters everyday! It’s much better than having to stick with the ones Snapchat randomly generates for you.

Snapchat is the most unique texting app I have ever seen. I would give it 5 stars, but there’s one problem. This isn’t just a problem for me, but many people. I tried to make a custom story with my friends but it doesn’t work. I love the idea, but it just isn’t working for a lot of people.

But above all I’m so sad that my old account got deleted for no reason, and now that I made another and see that all these bugs are even worse I think I should’ve just stayed w/o an account. Snapchat is totally useless now with all these bugs. Instead of upgrading it with all these unnecessary features I think Snapchat should focus more on the problems the app has..

I love snap chat I talk to all my friends and my biological mom on there that is currently the only way to reach her since her phone had been disabled due to her being out of work due to corona. I wondered what it might be so I went to google they told me a few things to try no luck. I wondered if it was just my device so I asked my friend to try on her phone she logged in and sure enough it worked at this point I’m not sure what to do I did everything the snap website told me to do.

What happened to “temporarily” being locked. I made another snap and once again got locked out of it. I made at least 2 more and it continued to lock me out of it. This quarantine stuff causes distance problems with me and my friends so snap is the only way I can talk to them. When I continually get locked out it gets frustrating and causes problems.

So every week you would encounter 8.75 minutes of adds. In turn every month 35.5 minutes of adds.

If I’ve been using my internet for more than 30 mins then get on Snapchat nothing loads and my snaps don’t send. They need to have a bigger and better bug fix. Every week it seems to not work and it’s always late at night when it doesn’t work ! So they REALLY need to improve that bc it gets very frustrating and annoying asf also when I try to save images and videos to camera roll it never works or just dosnt work for a while so that needs fixed too !!!!

2891,1,"Hey Snap Team,

Ive had Snapchat for atleast 3 years now and I love it bur recently I’ve been experiencing A LOT of glitching.

The most recent being it uploading 299 snaps to my story when I was uploading a 20 second long video. I had to delete and redone load the app to  delete all 299 of the glitched Snaps individually because they wouldn’t upload but kept trying to and wouldn’t delete.

Now my Snapchat keeps closing every 10 seconds making my experience less than enjoyable.

I have had common occurrences with tech issues like this where systems freeze or close me out saying my login information is not valid and I thought someone hacked my account but it wouldn’t let me change my password or anything and friends would say the same issue occurred for them as well.

I understand that globally the internet use is at an all time high and tech isn’t going to work perfectly but I also know that Snapchat used to run much more smoothly until these last few updates.",4/13/20 18:50,0.15796296296296294,0.3554629629629629,anticipation

Why do the filters make everything on your face smaller or bigger? Every cute filter on the app makes your nose and mouth smaller and your eyes bigger. Also “slims” your face, making certain head shapes look more circular than they really are. I feel more insecure using a Snapchat filter than asking my grandparents if they like my outfit. More insecure than standing at a school talent show in Alabama wearing a pride tshirt. More insecure than a singer on Americas Got Talent. More insecure than a non-binary on tumblr unironically.

I emailed support multiple times but all they sent was a message saying they couldn’t restore the streak.

Plus, you can’t see anyone’s posts and you can’t message anyone unless you follow them and they follow you back. If you guys follow each other and someone does something inappropriate, and you didn’t save the chat, you can go in settings and there is a button where you can revive all of the message you have ever sent. they will also bring up any messages they other person sent too. Lastly, if you report someone, it will immediately block them and report their account to the headquarters! This app is also super fun! It’s a fun way to communicate because when your kids go into their teen years, it’s not “cool” to text any more so this will be super fun! There’s all types of wonderful filters on this app which makes it amazing too! There are some cons but overall this is an amazing app!:)",5/2/20 2:44,0.32936507936507936,0.4801587301587302,positive
29,3,"Hello! I just wanted to say that I personally love Snapchat. I use it more often than iMessage. Though I have to say that the fact that there isn’t a recovery option for memories really bothers me, and I’m sure I’m not the only person who has run into a problem like this on Snapchat. I had a memory that I held dearly to me. I was editing my memory small segments at a time. When I was editing, there was a small segment of that memory that I didn’t want to keep, so I had tapped delete believing it would delete that portion only, not knowing that it was going to delete the entire snap itself. Having made it two years ago, I hadn’t realized till now that I didn’t save it to my camera roll at the time being. I was wondering if there’s any way possible to incorporate a recovery option into snap, or maybe even make it possible for us to recover our memories without saving them to our camera roll? Though if there is a way to recover memories without having saved them to my camera roll, I would really appreciate the tips and feedback. I lost all hope for saving the memory after seeing that it is stated on the Snapchat support page that there is no way of recovering unless backed up on the camera roll.",5/21/20 2:23,0.11666666666666665,0.6511574074074075,positive

61,2,"The chat textbox is way too short. There are five icons on that row, and only three are intuitive (camera, microphone, and smiley face). One icon is two rectangles overlapping each other (select photos), and one's a rocket ship. Yes, a rocket ship. How often am I going to be asking my friend to play a Snapchat game with me? Probably never, so why make the textbox smaller just for that meaningless icon? Instead of cluttering the chat textbox row and making the textbox a 1 inch wide oval, it would be nice if this mess of icons could be collapsed into a single menu to allow the chat textbox to take up most of the width of the screen so I can see what I'm typing. For reference, Discord's chat textbox takes up most of the width of the screen, and there are only three buttons there (attachment, emoji, send). Slack moves all those extra icons onto the next row so the chat textbox can be the full width of the screen minus one icon. Snapchat could do something similar to Discord and limit the chat textbox's row to having the diction button, emoji/bitmoji/etc, and photo (which would include camera, camera roll, and memories). The games button could be moved to the top of the screen next to the other infrequently used buttons.",5/2/19 4:27,0.04064625850340137,0.447108843537415,positive

I love the recent adds to the app such as: searching filters from local artists, snap group chat calling, and the timer for photos and videos. One thing I believe that Snapchat should have added a while back ago is the ability to select every user you have a streak with automatically. This would help snapchatters not take the time to click all their streaks and it would make the process more enjoyable. Also, snapchat has been having a couple bug fixes that are not up to par, but that are fixable. After you post on your story, your views somehow drop a couple hundred after around 12 hours past. Also, sometimes you watch the same stories over and over again. However, since these are minor and fixable errors that can be fixed with an update, the app still stays my most used app. It’s a great way to connect with friends & family and is one of the premier social media outlets.",5/27/19 14:40,0.22888888888888884,0.3527777777777778,positive

159,5,"Snapchat is great. I love how you can decorate the screen with stickers and gifs. There’s a lot of customization on your snaps, and making them unique. However, I would love the option to select a gif or sticker and favorite it. Make a folder for it, just like how there’s a recent option for the stickers and gifs that you have previously used. Just but a favorites folder next to that. And to add stickers or gifs to it you could either hold and drag them into the favorites folder, like you do when you throw away your cut outs. Or you could hold and press them giving you an option to do something with the sticker. Being able to favorite stickers and gifs would be extremely beneficial when you open up gifs and the “GIFHY TRENDING” appears. 

Second thing you could do is be able to hold down on a sticker or gif and then find out what to search up if you would like to use it in the future. Thank you.",5/7/19 1:31,0.2133986928104575,0.5059640522875818,positive

Example: back when there was a photos/videos tab you could click the videos tab and it would separate your videos from your photos making it easier to find what you want to post. Everything from the camera roll is together and some people, like me, have a lot in their camera roll so I have to scroll far and look through each and every picture. It would also be great if we were able to choose from the albums that we created in our phone camera roll.

235,2,I have been using snapchat religiously for the past six years. It is the only platform I use to communicate with my friends and hardly text them anymore. I’ve been with snapchat since the time you had to hold down on the snap to view it. Yesterday I was using snapchat as I do every day when all of the sudden I become logged out of my account as if someone else logged in. When I try to log back in it says my account is locked and I’m unable to access it. I have tried to sign in periodically but it has stayed this same way for almost 24 hours now. Im worried I will lose all my memories from the past years because I don’t have them backed up to my camera roll. There’s no way for me to save my memories without being on the app. I will also lose very long streaks and I don’t know what to do. I have tried contacting someone at the Snapchat headquarters but I am never assisted. If I could receive any aid in recovering my account or saving my memories I would be incredibly appreciative.

246,3,So I’ve been a Snapchat user since 2016. It’s a great way to communicate with others if you can’t have any other social media. You have send snaps and receive snaps. I’ve enjoyed this app because it helps me post things that others can see but only if they are my friends. I like that you don’t have to accept everyone as your friend. I would have given this app 5 stars but...the updates got me screaming! At first the Snapchat logo changed which wasn’t a big deal. But recently I got a update that kind of looks bad. They mad the app worst by adding the map when you try to slide to see the message someone sent you. Sliding is technically really helpfully because it allows you to see a message when you don’t want to open it. The new update doesn’t all this anymore. I definitely prefer the older Snapchat. The only thing I like about the updates is that it’s not as laggy as before and there’s many new fonts.,5/30/20 19:17,0.04363636363636366,0.5542045454545456,trust
252,1,"This has been happening for a few days now. I love to look at my memories from x years ago when they appear, but when tapping through them, the app freezes and my phone freezes. Pressing the home button doesn’t work, you have to press the lock button and doing it once will dim the screen. Doing it twice will lock your phone and take you back to home. I don’t think there’s anywhere to look through the memory snaps without the app completely freezing my phone. It makes it hard because being able to look through memories is a feature I love, but I can’t watch them all anymore because of this bug. Not to mention, loading up the app for me has been much more sluggish than before. I don’t think it’s completely my phone. The camera often lags to actually open, tapping on different pages like stories, snaps, or snap map lags and struggles to seamlessly switch over. I’m just hoping I’m not alone in these issues and these bugs can be sorted by the next update.",5/3/21 6:07,0.13630952380952382,0.3904761904761904,positive
269,4,"I would totally give 5 stars but however because I can’t skip stupid ads, yes yes I know most of them are only 5-10 seconds sometimes 20 secs but that’s 5-20 seconds that I could be looking and laughing at stupid videos. I also hate how all the articles they have are riddled with ads and majority of the time I can’t even read a full article because they constantly repeat themselves for like 3 pages (I know that’s not SnapChats fault but pick articles that don’t repeat themselves a million and a half times just to tell a story that should’ve/could’ve been a one page article), ads pop up like crazy that cover the article, and it takes forever to load the article. 
But I love the filters!! I wish you would keep allllll the filters you ever had on there instead of switching them out weekly or however you switch them out:P
But I am still very happy with SnapChat:)",5/31/19 4:02,-0.002724358974358956,0.7461538461538461,negative
270,5,"I truly have no problems with this app. There are no purposely annoying ads, it is private to only the people of your choice, and it has a great privacy policy. I feel like Snapchat is just one of those apps that is actually worth getting 100% for everyone at any age. And if your a parent or guardian deciding whether or not Snapchat is safe for your child or if it is addicting, I can promise you there will be no problem with either. I’ve never gotten hacked or had a problem with my privacy nor have I known anyone who has. I also will say that Snapchat can become a little addicting at first but as you carry on you will use Snapchat as a day to day source, and it will only bring a little communication between one or more people.

I’m always getting “Couldn’t load. Please retry again” whenever it comes to looking at people’s stories, trying to add someone that’s been tagged in a story, anything tagged in a story, can’t do links or yolo’s or even try a filter that’s been added in a story. Nor can I look at how many people view my story. And the crazy thing is that I know people have looked at it because they’ve replied to it. I can’t log out of my Snapchat because it says something is wrong with my connection. I don’t know how when messages send just fine and I’m able to look at stuff and do things. Snapchat suggest using my data, same story, not the issue. I don’t know what’s going on with my Snapchat, but can you please fix it.

280,4,"🔆 Suggestions  🔆

There needs to be a way that you can view your entire friend’s list all at once. The only way you can view it is by taking a snap and going to your send section. You also should be able to see the AMOUNT of friends you have, as well as people who have unfriended you.
WE NEED A “SEND ALL” BUTTON. I don’t understand how Snapchat has been around this long and doesn’t have a “send to all” option. It’s ludicrous and makes using the app extremely difficult.
People who unfriend you should also be removed from your friend’s list too. It is‘t logical that they still are on your list if they’ve already removed you. It takes up space on my friend’s list.
It needs to be clearer how you obtain a subscribe button. It’s not clear at all and there’s no info via Snapchat, I’ve only been able to find info online.
The call button feature in the chat is WAY too easy to press, there needs to be an “Are You Sure” button when you click on it because I accidentally click it ALL the time and it’s so annoying. It shouldn’t be that easy to accidentally click.
This app is fantastic and keeps me so well connected with my friends. I hope that you take my suggestions because I can guarantee you people agree with me and want to see the changes made.",5/17/20 20:27,0.11547619047619048,0.7331349206349207,positive
287,3,"I’ve had Snapchat for almost 3 years, and at first I was excited because of all the filters and everything, but from 8 months ago to now it has been extremely irritating at times. there is bugs and glitches a lot of times when I’m using it. sometimes snaps don’t load and I have to wait a few hours to see them. I am in agreement that we should be able to change our users. They have been updating the app for months now but I have noticed no difference. sometimes the app starts glitching on purpose just so that I can go update it. Furthermore,The new update we have has become irritating because now people are able to see when we peek. it’s kinda frustrating because most people I really don’t want to talk to text me and I want to peek but with the new update it shows them I peeked. I believe they should not have that update. But for now I truly hope Snapchat is able to improve its ways.",5/13/20 4:53,0.1305944055944056,0.5513403263403264,positive
300,4,"Ok, this app is pretty good and it’s pretty useful to get ahold of my friends. I’m writing this review becaise I have a concern for myself and younger people that have the app. I give this app four stars because it is amazing however, I was looking through one of my friends stories and the story was over and an add pops up. I am just going to say that that add was not a very appropriate add and I am in middle school. I know the difference between good and bad and this one was not ok. I love this app a lot but I would appreciate it if you guys would check to make sure that your adds are appropriate for all of the ages that are using the app. I love this app and don’t get me wrong I am not trying to send any hate I am just trying to make a suggestion so that you have more people get the app and more ages and better reviews.

I also understand that it is not snapchats fault in any way shape or form for what happened bc of this “alert or feature ” I guess you would say this is just my opinion on it. I completely understand you can’t do anything about her being mad and it’s not your fault this happened.

First of all lots of children use this app and every other add I see is about cheating on your significant other or being unfaithful or using tender. Like really, What kind of message are the creators trying to send out to young people ?? It honestly disgusts me. On top of that all the adds for stories; even if it’s an interesting article that I actually want to read the articles are all basically 7-10 pages of filler that completely waists your time; then, by the time you FINALLY get to the punchline of the story it’s glitches out and gives you some stupid add for a Walmart gift card or something that’s very clearly trying to rip you off or put a virus on your phone.

I forgot my password and went to reset it, in the past when this has happened you just plug in your cellphone number and it lets you reset your password. This time it told me my phone number can’t be verified, and that I’d need to log in with an email. As I’ve had my account for four years, the email I used to create the account had since been deleted by my alma Mater. Being that I still have my phone number, Snapchats site says IT should be able to verify my account and help me get back in.  WRONG. It has been over 8 days, I’ve contacted them on their support multiple times and on Twitter and have heard NOTHING back from support. It’s disappointing, frustrating, and is beginning to feel useless. I had contacts on my Snapchat from college, work, and various mission trips I will never be able to get back.

Then, I exited the app, logged back in, and on that SAME post I had 209 views. I am not talking about the previous post deleting, I am talking about literally the same, exact post before, had dropped its views down significantly. This is definitely aggravating, as it should be because I want to get an accurate portrayal of the amount of views I get all of the time.

My wifi is working on every other app on my phone, but for some reason snapchat only halfway works on my data connection, and I've even tried messing with my router and it still is acting like this. My friends snaps aren't showing up, and my snaps will say ""failed to send, try again"" after literally a second of me attempting to send them. I would just use my data to use the app, but unfortunately I live in an area where we are very far from a cell tower.

479,1,"I enjoyed Snapchat 1.0, back when is was simply an app to send pictures to your friends. I got off Snapchat a few years ago because inappropriate and provocative stories started popping up in my news feed. I’ve been checking back every half year or so since then to see if there’s some kind of “parental controls” to filter out the inappropriate stuff, and every time I’m disappointed to find out it’s only gotten worse. I’m truly upset at the fact that this app is advertised to kids “12+” and thrives on using click-baity titles to get children addicted to reading inappropriate, irrelevant, and often inaccurate content. The articles posted promote a culture of comparison and entitlement which I believe is a huge reason why so many people of our generation struggle with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression! Please stop thinking about how to get more money, and start thinking about how the changes y’all make affect the millions of kids who use Snapchat!",5/31/19 14:11,0.0063725490196078404,0.5161064425770308,negative

It’s incredibly annoying and quite destructive to my hearing. Second, friends send me multiple snaps at once, for example 4, it’s a pretty normal thing, we do it all the time. But most of the time I’ll receive only 2 of those snaps and then the rest will come through the NEXT day. These are the biggest glitches I’ve experienced so far, please fix these as i use Snapchat on a daily basis and obviously listen to music on a daily basis and just want to stay in tune to the whole conversation not just half of it when only half the amount of snaps come through!",5/21/20 4:35,0.007608695652173908,0.46980676328502413,positive

Sending a quick selfie on snap was easy the recipient only sees it for a minute and the filters are fun. That being said, the fact that there has been no update to fix the issue of the front-facing camera on this app is extremely irritating... the front camera is so zoomed in and it’s even more apparent when you compare it to an older generation iPhone... with my arm completely stretched out I still can’t see more than my face in the camera?? Absolutely ridiculous and makes this app basically pointless in my opinion. Also, the fact that this has been an issue since the iPhone X was released, two years ago solidifies that Snapchat isn’t going to fix this issue anytime soon.

Obviously there will be false bans, so why is there no way to appeal them? Or why won’t they even tell me why exactly my account got deleted?

516,4,"I use Snapchat regularly.  It’s convenient and easy way to chat with people, has some cute emoji and Bitmoji features, and allows for deleting or only temporarily allowing people to view what you sent them.  My one big caveat to Snapchat is the “friend emoji” feature.  Specifically the “eek” 😬 emoji.  This one in particular pops up when you and someone else have a mutual best friend (you both chat with this person the most).  This means that say, for example, you have been chatting with someone you might be interested in and the person they chat with the most.  Seems like a weird way for your Snapchat habits to be available to others.  One of the things this app touts is it’s privacy features.  This is in blatant opposition to that.

For example, I will send someone a snap and on my phone it says “delivered” and stays that way. Even though the person opens my snap and sends one back it says I’m on delivered, which to me looks like the person is ignoring me, and to them it looks like I’m ignoring them because I never reply to their snap because I didn’t get it in the first place.

762,5,this is the best app I use it daily I love when you have a group you can’t kick no one out and no one can kick you out and when you leave everything is gone all the messages I hate how Instagram saves the messages even if you leave that’s dumb and I love the filters everything works amazing just one last thing to top it all of is we need dark mode. But I love this app keep doing great ! Don’t change the group setting don’t be like Instagram! Thank you i love you!! Also I love how they don’t save the snaps and you can only open it 2 times amazing and you know when there in the chat or not and when they screenshot!!

My one complaint is the ads they have when you’re watching stories. 
Some of them seem like super interesting articles but half of the time there’s two or three sentences on each page and you have to keep scrolling down past all these ads and pictures to read a little snippet that might say “the couple had no idea what was in store for them. They opened the door to the home and walked in...” and then you have to repeat the scroll read click process 20 times to read the whole article. 
It’s extremely frustrating so I usually end up just googling the article on another website",5/28/19 2:42,0.05758547008547006,0.4555555555555556,positive

I’m not the only person facing this issue, on twitter it’s many people reaching out to snapchat saying the same thing is happening to them.

If you’re like self conscious or something about the way you look there’s a lot of subtle filters that can change the way you look to whatever you want.

Why not make it so that it isn’t such a chore to test out filters that are all the way at the bottom of the list — otherwise users will be less likely to check out filters that have been created by other Snapchat users (which are far superior, fun, and creatively-made than a lot of the stock filters I’ve used recently).

To reiterate, when I Select a filter, Try it out, and then go Back to the list, I would like to go back to the EXACT POINT ON THE LIST  where I just was before selecting that last filter I just used.

I’m tired of having to scroll past the same old filters every time I click on a new one. Developers, please fix this issue!

Secondly, would you please allow us a repository of our favorite filters, where we save the ones that we like the most.

Imagine if you had accidentally posted something you didn’t want to and somebody saved it to the chat. There’s no way you can have it removed besides asking the person to “unsave” it.

I’ve tested this multiple time with different friends. They can still see your story because they saved it in the chat, even if you deleted the story completely.

1294,1,"Snapchat has been my ride or die since 2014. I have used this app forever and have been through all types of updates. Recently, my snapchat updated itself to this weird “new” snap that looks a lot like it did in 2015 before the weird story update. I hate it. What is the need for the bar on the bottom? Why is snap maps on another panel? It is inconvenient as hell to have it on that side. Additionally, some snaps i send NEVER deliver and on the other side it shows up as left on open mid conversation. Please fix this as it has screwed up some relationships because it usually happens mid argument. Please let me go back to the original snap. But low key if all my friends weren’t in this app I’d delete it because of how ugly the new update is and how stupid the problems with this app are.",5/29/20 4:59,-0.19090909090909092,0.5386363636363637,negative

Sending me random notifications, ads and suggested pages, all mocking me and what I have going on in my personal life. Even the people and account names on quick adds were making sentences when you put the names together in a line being cruel and extremely disrespectful. Again all directed towards me and my personal life. Not random at all. I would have thought I was going crazy if I didn’t have people validate my assumption of being hacked.

Now u have to swipe all the way to the left and when u swipe on a conversation it just take u to snap maps. Now we can’t view a conversation without saying we opened it. Idk who decided it would be a good idea to make the app look like Snapchat but please pull an “Instagram” and take away the update please.

So first off I wanna thank y’all for trying your best to make it work and keep giving us new things to make it interesting, but I only have one major complaint. 
When someone becomes apart of my best friends list, especially the #1 best friend because I talk to them often, my chat with them lags like crazy. 
For example, if I want to send a message it takes a few seconds for it to pop up, then a few more to load, and then even more to save it. I also can’t see their reply right away, so in order to have me say a sentence and get their response, it takes about 10 seconds. This frustrates me a lot because I don’t even talk to a ton of people, so of course it’s bothersome that this would happen to the few couple people I do talk to on a daily basis. 
I have went back and cleared as much of my storage as I could, I tried updating, reinstalling, completely restarting my phone, but nothing works. 
And this ONLY happens to the chats I have with people I talk to constantly.

2579,1,"Oh, you thought Instagram caused anxiety and depression? Nothing has made me more anxious, sad, angry and depressed as Snapchat. Not only that, but the glitches, face filters, news and drama on the app is insanity.

Mental illness: Nothing has caused me more anxiety and depression as this app has. For years, I had to deal with keeping up with dumb, useless streaks, as if they signify a true friendship. Not just that, but the drama that people create or talk about on the app is so toxic that it hurts.

Glitches: For a while not, Snapchat has been dealing with awful glitches, as you probably already know, and it’s bad. Not just that, but it practically burns holes in your data and battery.

Face filters: Most of the face filters are cringey and nobody uses them. Some are really cringey.

Shows: Don’t even get me started on the shows on the app. Most of it is useless and unwanted. There’s tons of beauty guru, life hack and tiktok content on there, and it’s annoying as hell.

So I thought the best way was to delete the app the download it again. So I did that, but then it wasn’t letting me log into my account? It kept saying “check your internet” and everything was just slow. When I finally got back into my account after like 5 minutes.. it showed I didn’t have any friends or anything, no pictures, no nothing, and then it finally loaded again after like 5 minutes. I can’t post stuff in my story without seeing the “failed to post” thing. My snaps were disappearing too, and they were my friends snaps not showing up. I finally got the app to work but not as well because it still is doing the same thing other than me being able to see my friends snaps. I hope you fix it soon because I’m really not enjoying how it is right now because it’s not working for anyone and my internet is perfectly fine. So that’s why I’m asking you again to just fix the problem. Please and thank you!",6/3/19 2:32,0.0769717261904762,0.4787946428571428,positive
33,3,"Ok so I have been using Snapchat for a while now. It’s a great app I use it to keep in touch with my friends and post random stuff. But lately, snapchats been bugging out. So here’s my problem:
I viewed my friends story nothing unusual, then it slid to the next persons story and so on and so fourth. Then a couple hours later I go back to Snapchat and it says I haven’t viewed their story yet. I was a little confused but viewed there story again anyway. I could see that they posted something new because I saw it on the little circle thing next to their name😂. But when I viewed the story I saw the exact same story I already viewed. This happened with four different people. I thought it was my phone even though it’s brand new. So I deleted Snapchat, logged back in, and the same thing happened. I did that numerous times before I just gave up and decided to write a review. (also another issue was I viewed one persons story then the next then the next but after that one as I was tapping for the next persons story it kept showing me that same persons story when there were still more to view?)
I really hope you take the time to read my review and fix this little issue.😊",6/3/19 22:08,0.03429383116883117,0.317288961038961,anticipation

51,5,Okay where do I start.. Snapchat is an amazing app because you can FaceTime and text your friends if you or your friends don’t have minutes on your phone. Also I love the filler’s and I like how you can block people  if the are being rude I’ve had to do that a couple of times.. and I like how you can save chats just in case someone is being rude to your friends they if you save them you can show your friends what the person has been saying about them. And now let’s talk about updates..ever since the update my Snapchat isn’t working as well as it was but it still works good and sometimes it pops up that I have know filler’s. BUT  it is because I never refresh my Snapchat😂 So remember if something weird happens alway refresh your Snapchat DON’T  be like me and never refresh your Snapchat... so that was just a little story that happened to me about a week ago😂 but yes Snapchat is amazing oh and another thing do not add strangers.. trust me I done that but let’s not even go there😬😬 And yes if you are aloud I recommend you getting Snapchat👻👻 bye,6/1/19 13:42,0.17916666666666667,0.688888888888889,positive

So now I got a ten second story that was supposed to be a minute long in total....and the rest of the videos are gone because I didn’t save them because I didn’t think I had too..anyways...onto the next problem...I wake up this morning and try to look at my other friends stories...and it won’t play theirs either...it’ll play their old ones that I’ve already seen but none of the new ones that they’ve posted in the last hour or so. Plus it keeps recycling the same persons story when I try to click through them to get to the next person. I’m not sure if it’s an update error or if it’s a minor bug but I would really like for it to be cleared up soon. Other than these two recent problems I haven’t had any issues with the app!

60,4,"I love Snapchat it is an amazing app. It is great for texting your friends and sending them pictures or playing games. Although, lately it has been annoying me. As I said, I like to play the games. I like the ones where you open the front camera and then hold down to get the lenses and then when you swipe left you get to choose a game to play. I recently got an IPhone XR and when I try to play the games it’ll either not give me the option to play my next turn or it won’t let me click the play button. I always replay the snap in hopes that it’ll let me play but it never works. This never happened when I had my iPhone 7, so I’m thinking it has something to do with the fact that Snapchat is trying to adjust it to the new phone but I’m not to sure. I’m hoping that this will eventually be fixed so that I can continue to enjoy my experience.

I also love love the filter ones!! That’s what I usually take my photos with, for my Instagram, and to send to my friends😫❤️ I love to scroll down threw my saved to see all the cringe, butttt funny memories that I’ve gotten to make. But lately snap has been getting really glitchy and it shows me snaps, storys, and chats that I’ve already opened and sometimes with out me even opening they GO AWAY! And it really upsets me, because what if it was really important, you know? Another problem is the streaks thing! I have like 30 but I lost my highest streak (344) and she had already sent streaks to me! And the other day me and my cousin were sending each other videos of each other cause we were right beside one another and it told us we lost our streak when we where just send photos/videos of each other!👎🏻😡",6/25/19 16:15,0.267906746031746,0.5829517704517704,positive

72,3,"Snapchat is notorious for not listening to their users. Everybody knows this. But snapchat is growing old. We all want something new. For starters, it’s high-time Snapchat joins the dark mode team. I don’t want the light from chats glaring in my eyes at night. Secondly, stories used to be so simple but now I can never find my friends’ stories. There is WAY too much going on with the interface. It’s too confusing, too complex. People like simple. Third, bring back best friends. Snapchat has become so exclusive. We want to know what are friends are up to and it’s all so closed off. Bring back best friends and just make it optional. You guys never listen to users. Snapchat is tired. So much needs changed. Giving 3 stars because it went from a simple, fun app to confusing. I don’t even check the right side of Snapchat because it’s just filled with “recommendations” that I don’t want to see and people I DON’T know. What is even going on on the right side of Snapchat? We have stories on the left but then on the right too? Except the right shows me stories of people I can never find. What sense does that make? Highly irritated.

88,1,"I don’t know why I ever downloaded it in the first place, but since I only use it on occasion, I don’t think on it that often. At the beginning, I did all of the setup routines by choosing my interests and subscriptions, which includes mostly cooking and animals. It didn’t take long for me to realize how much I hated the program. First, no matter what you choose to subscribe to, the foul Kardashian/Jenner clan will always pop up. I can’t go a day without hearing about the one who redid her whole face just so she could look like her siblings. It’s amazing how a few basic girls can fool a nation into thinking they are hot, innovative, and genuine! Second, the stories that do seem somewhat interesting must have been written by a high school dropout. I teach English, and one of the common topics that I discuss with students is brevity and getting to the point. Someone needs to review that with the crap writers on here. Lastly, the program itself bugs out constantly. I am usually in the middle of an article when it just ends. The only way to get back to it is to scroll through the crap that you already read.

122,5,Snapchat is an app I use on the daily. I love being able to talk to all my friends and making new ones. The past two days my Snapchat has been acting really strange. When I attempt to add something to my story it won’t upload and it asks me to try again. When it does go through and uploads it says no one has viewed it. Even when it’s been up to 7 hours and usually I have a lot of people view it by then. Another problem that is happening is that snaps that was sent to me at night come through the next morning. Not only these problems but also it shows were someone has put something new on their story and I tap on it but yet it won’t show me the new snap. Just the older ones. A lot of people have been talking about this problem and I think the Snapchat team could look to see what they can do to fix it.

129,3,"I've had Snapchat for years now, and it just seems like the longer I have it, the more bugs there are. I cannot tell you how many times I've watched a story to the end only to still have a purple outline around it, telling me that I have not watched it. Recently, it's been making me watch the same story multiple times with no end to it unless I swipe out of it. I DO enjoy the new features they come out with like the Snapchat map to see what my friends are up to, the new tools you can use to edit your Snapchats (I love those so much!), and some of the stories or subscriptions they have on the Discover page. However, from what another user noted in their review, I do agree that the subscriptions are very heavily biased (or even click-bait) and I dislike how one-sided they are. This makes me feel that you do not encourage your users to have their own points of views on different topics. Anyway, for me, bugs have begun to outweigh the things I like about Snapchat because that's all I have been dealing with for a while.

I know for a fact that it’s not a repost because I asked them.. Snapchat is genuinely just making me watch people’s stories from 2 or even 3 days ago. 
I find this as a genuine problem because I have a good amount of people’s stories to look at, and when I’m re-watching the same persons previous story over and over again, it makes the entire experience way more unenjoyable. 
I also thought that it was so cool that snapchats whole gimmick was like “snaps disappear after 24 hours” or whatever. Now I worry that other people are seeing my snaps after they (supposedly) disappear. 
And what if I personally delete them? Will some people still continue to see the deleted snap? Wow I hope not!

Later my mic again cut out while I was recording on snap, so I deleted it again, and since I haven’t had one tiny issue with the mic on any app. Could this be from having too much storage in my Snapchat?

221,3,I am an avid snapchat user and I’d say that it has become a part of my everyday routine. The one thing that I have an issue with is that your company continues to change the look/layout of the app which I really don’t understand why. No one I know has ever complained about how snapchat looks and I really do not want to once again get used to another update and figure out how to use it. I think it is really insensitive and not to be rude but no apps that I know of including Instagram changes as much as snapchat does and with all due respect it’s not okay. The new update with the black bar at the bottom is not well designed and I do not like the way it looks at all. I know it’s too late for the company to change it back but please stop changing the layout speaking for me and many many of my friends and people I associate with.

253,3,"Snapchat alone so far has recently released a update to which it is causing not only my account but several others as well to malfunction to where it will constantly have a pop up on the screen saying “could not refresh” that alone and being the fact that Snap Maps is also malfunctioning. Aside from that another thing minor glitch is with the stories of people. By watching their stories it doesn’t make their stories go to the back of the line of where the rest are, instead it stays there showing the refresh sign over the story signifying that there’s no other new post on the story like how it normally does but it just stays there. Snapchat alone has never given me any problems and even when there would be glitches in them. They’ve always fixed the problem, so I trust that they’ll have it running back in no time.

260,4,"I, along with many others, have snapstreaks with more people than can fit in our “recents” list of who we’ve most recently snapped. As a result, when we send our streaks, we have to scroll through our whole friends list, selecting every person with which we have a streak. As you can imagine, this takes a very long time when one has a large number of snapchat friends to scroll through so that they can select the friends with which they have streaks. A feature that allowed for a user to select all friends with which they have streaks with the click of one button would be very appealing to not only people who currently keep streaks but it would also attract more snapchat users to start streaks because of the efficiency of the new feature. Thank you for taking my input and I hope to see this feature on snapchat in the future.",6/6/20 0:00,0.25254638218923936,0.4734369202226345,positive
263,3,"I love Snapchat and it’s one of my most used apps but there could be some MAJOR improvement.
1- can you get the system to stop replaying stories over and over and over again when we watched them like a billion times it’s really annoying.
2-I don’t know if I’m the only one going through this but when you log out of your account or if your logged out when you try to log back in and put the correct I repeat CORRECT password it says “Incorrect”. The first time this happened to me I was so scared because I thought I had lost my account, I had to go to the website, change my password through emails,sign in online and unlock my account there! I had to go through this scary process 2 times !. 
3-Now when people try to log in it continues saying “Could not Refresh”, this is just as annoying as the repeated stories, Snapchat is a great app lots and lots of users use and it’d be much greater if there weren’t bugs along the way .💀🔚",6/6/19 11:16,0.0409090909090909,0.6348484848484849,trust
264,1,First off for no reason snap logs me out and I have to sign back in. Which I really hate and every time I log out it takes years to load anything. Second you can only send a certain number of snaps at once you should be able to send to everyone on snap if you want all in one go so I don’t have to send streaks twice cause I can’t add anymore snap chatters. Third there’s a ton of bugs like I have an iPhone XR that works well and for some reason if I send a handful of snaps too fast it crashes to the home screen and all the snaps I sent or were sending are gone and it’s the same before. I used to enjoy this app but now it’s becoming a hassle to use. Finally my last complaint which is my biggest one is that I can’t add anymore people I have to block people jus to add people back I shouldn’t have a limit on how many people are on my snap it won’t let me add unless I unfriend someone. Please get back to me and tell me how I can fix these problems cause I’ve had snap since it was developed and I definitely don’t wanna switch to texting or instagram.,6/5/19 12:53,0.07969924812030076,0.37218045112781956,positive
275,4,"I’ve had Snapchat for 5-6 years, and I’ve loved it since the day I made my account. I love all the features it has, and I love the way it makes it easy to talk and send pictures to friends. But there’s a few things that I’ve had in mind for the last few years that I think could bring this app to its full potential.

1. Dark Mode
    Everyone loves dark mode, and it would really bring more appeal to the app.

2. “Like” stories
     It would able super cool to be able to like a story just like Facebook or instagram. Often I wish I could tell people what I think without having to slide up and type it.

3. A live function
    Of all apps that allow you to go live, none of them make sense. On Facebook I have tons of friends that I don’t know, and the same for Instagram and twitter. I actually have all my real life friends on Snapchat, so it would make sense that I would wanna go live there, and they could all join or watch their friends or be watched by their friends, not strangers.

All these ideas I’ve discussed with my friends. They all think they make sense and would be super cool additions and functions for the app. I feel like you might have some of these ideas already on your drawing board, but either way I would love to see some of them come to life soon. 

     Thanks for a great app!",6/21/20 16:33,0.25568181818181823,0.4860119047619048,positive

And sometimes when I don’t notice that they text me or send me a snap and I don’t see anything in my inbox, I don’t notice it and most of the time we have a streak so I won’t be able to get their snap and the streak dies without warning.

294,3,Snapchat used to be great but the updates over the past month or so have ruined the app. I’m just gonna list the problems I’ve been having with the app: My notifications are always delayed by like 30 seconds so it makes me think I’ve gotten a new snap but it’s just the previous snap notification. None of my memories have been saving unless I want to wait 10 minutes. I don’t like when I swipe to view a conversation and it takes me to my snap map and you can’t swipe back so you have to press the chat button. I have to press my text box before I can type and sometimes I can’t type at all and have to restart the app. My story says I’ve been getting zero viewers and sometimes it doesn’t even show a number for the views. And lastly that I think of at the top of my head is that when ever I view someone’s story it says that I’ve screenshoted it.

However instead of just not showing their stories like any normal app would do they instead keep the stories there but just made it grey. the whole purpose of muting peoples stories was so I wouldnt have to see there stories. whats the point of muting peoples stories if their still right there in front of you. and dont even get me started with the ads you say your not interested in an ad and what do you know that same ad shows up the next day. whats the point of having a feature to mute stuff if it doesnt even mute things. this app used to be such an awesome app but now it has burned down to just total trash if my friends didnt only communicate through snapchat groupchats i would have gotten rid of this app long ago. its so sad just please change the stories so if i mute them i dont see their stories,6/26/20 0:44,0.053939909297052134,0.5178287981859411,positive

2. It would take forever o load the snaps that people were sending me. But those two reasons could have been because of my wifi connection.
3. You know how Snapchat can access your camera roll. Well Snapchat won’t load my recent screenshots into the camera roll. It also won’t load into my actual camera roll. So I though I could fix the problem by un downloading it and then re downloading it, but that didn’t do anything.

563,3,"I honestly love this app! I have been using it for years and it’s an easy way to connect to people. The problem is the uploading quality...I have a brand new phone and I have checked all problems to see if it was something with my phone but it’s not. I can save a video/photo to my memories and it’ll be crystal clear but as soon as I upload it either from memories or the direct recording it is blurry. Yes, there might be other minor issues but those are easy to get past or be fixed. I make a big deal about this because I want SNAP on Snapchat...I want to post so others can see it without it being blurry or indescribable. I want use the app for its main function SNAPPING! Once the uploading quality is fixed, this would be my favorite app it’s already one of my most used! Thank you!!",6/9/20 15:03,0.21919507575757577,0.4441919191919192,positive

I’ve tried everything i can think of: restarting the modem, my phone, turning the wifi on and off, logging out of the app, deleting and reinstalling the app. I’m at my wit’s end trying to figure why I can’t see my boyfriend‘s messages.

Edit: When i post on my story it only stays on the story for a few minutes, I can’t see if anyone saw it, I can now access my memories but I only have the ones from March of 2019 and onward even though I know I have stuff from 2015 saved. I am also able to send messages but cannot receive any or if I do receive one or 2 they are sent way later than the time stamp shows me.

You guys are doing great so far, but I would like to recommend something. So on IMessage they allow us to use gifs or what not and it’s just a great way to show our friends what we are feeling. So I was wondering if you can put that in the chat at the bottom, right above the keyboard, so we can use the gifs. It would really make the app much better and easier way to get out our emotions and feelings, because the gifs have a variety of things you can pick and that’s just awesome that they have it.

All of my messages to friends were also on that account since most people my age only really use Snapchat. I’m so upset, especially since their customer support did absolutely nothing to help me get it back other than send me an automated message saying “if your account was hacked make sure to change your password” yeah news flash I can’t do that since they changed the password and took my number and email off the account.

645,2,I love Snapchat but the design change looks horrible. It’s so annoying to navigate through when before it was only 3 simple swipes and wasn’t rocket science. Now I can’t even swipe into the chats I need to click them (which we are all used to swiping). When I’m inside a chat and I try to type it doesn’t let me type sometimes I have to swipe out and back in for it to work. Also another thing about the redesign there should be an accessibility and preferences option so people can choose between the old version and new design or light mode and dark mode. Or we could be able to choose how to navigate like if we want to swipe or click to open chats etc. So overall the app is good but these new designs or changes should come with more options not one design change that most people do not like.

I’ve been logged out whether that be crashes or someone else trying to access it. Snaps sent to me can’t be viewed neither can stories posted. In all honesty the only reason I still have Snapchat it to stay in contact with certain people. That being said, genuinely illustrates how frustrated and overall perplexed I am. No matter how many updates for “bug fixes” come out, it seems as if it’s only getting worse. I would ask that these issues be taken care of, but frankly it’s not that simple.

798,2,"Okay, don’t get me wrong, I love Snapchat. It’s my most used app and I use it every single day. But there’s a few things that I don’t quite think are working right.
First of all, sometimes when I try and open a snap/video, it will give the option to “Tap to load.” Once that is pressed, it will show “Tap to open.”, right? Once THAT is pressed, it immediately goes back to “tap to load.” This happens constantly and I will often have to restart the app or even my phone for it to work.
Another thing. The app will often give me the notification that it cannot save videos or pictures, regardless of the storage on my phone or even the app. No matter what I do, it will give the same notification and it is rather bothersome.
And something else that has been bothering me. I won’t get or receive messages, period. My phone will give me the notification that I’ve received a message, and I’ll go to Snapchat to find the “delivered” notification. No matter how many times I refresh it, it stays the same.

Something to remember though, these have only been bothering me within the last week, and it’s probably a bug from a new update or something I hope I can continue to use this app without fault in the future! :)",6/15/19 5:23,0.1279220779220779,0.42612347969490827,positive

812,2,"Like many of the other low star reviews of snapchat, I also experience stories not loading or saying I haven’t seen them when I have. Chats not sending when I have excellent service or connection, or just the occasional Snapchat telling me I have no network connection. My biggest problem with this app, however, is the fact that I cannot even use it on my phone. When I reach out to the snapchat support on twitter they tell my my account is locked and give me a super scripted response. I cannot log onto my phone without snapchat giving me a temporary ban which I have no clue why I receive. I’ve never used any third party apps or anything that violates the ToS. I can log into my account anywhere else but my phone.

858,1,I love Snapchat and I’ve been using it since the app was developed. Here recently my account just stopped allowing me to add and accept friend request. It’s going on a week now of not being able to add anyone. I tried reaching out through Snapchat support but got nothing in return. This a HUGE issue because Snapchat was built on connecting with people and now it won’t let me connect with anyone at all. I tried turning my phone on and off tried to login and out out of Snapchat deleted and re downloaded the app and still can’t add or accept people. It’s getting really aggravating. Also Snapchat doesn’t have a way to directly get in contact with them about problem like this. You just have to send them a notice and then just keep waiting never to hear back from them again.

I wish SnapChat had certain features like Instagram, some examples are (but not limited to) when I post a picture and I would like to add music to it. Another example is how Instagram has certain features like polls, ask questions, little fun activities for one’s followers to get to know each other. My last example would be how people just want to share their taste of music and show the lyrics of the song or what album that song came from.

The second issue is that it will not allow me to see my stories views and see how many people have seen it. Another issue has come up for many and it will say that a snap had been sent to you, but you go in the app and there is no notification, this needs to be immediately fixed.

That means I’ve seen the changes Snapchat has developed, but right now in the present Snapchat just reverted back.

  By IT I don’t mean Pennywise the clown, by IT I mean the app in general. It won’t let me view my friends stories, the filters don’t properly work either and it won’t even let me add to my own story. On top of that, why do I have to watch an ad just to view my own friends story?

894,2,So I used to love Snapchat. It was a really good app. I saved all the photos in there that I took of my pets and vacation. Then something happened. I opened Snapchat one day and it was just a black screen. That happens a lot with other apps to idk why. So I thought I could just delete it and then log in again. But when I tried to log in again it said my password was incorrect. So then I pressed “forget password” and I changed my password with my phone number. Then it said that my phone number was incorrect.....that WAS my phone number!! So then I changed my password with my email. It said my email was incorrect....that WAS my email!! So then I had to make a new account. And now all of my pictures and memories from my other account are all Gone.

917,1,"I love Snapchat and have been using it since March 1st, 2018. It's very good and funny, and I love the fact that on Sarcastic Smile, if you scream loud enough, my mic makes a weird noise! (I love that part, don't worry) but there are, in fact, bugs I run into.

While making a video, for whatever reason, the screen would freeze on this one filter. And when I would stop the video and see it, it would only show the parts of which BEFORE it froze. When I'd discard the snap, it would show the filter for like half of a second, then go back to no filters.

Something that happens to me on all filters is that sometimes, I would start a video, (swipe left to lock video) and then I'd let go, but then the filter would disappear. It happens to me quite the bit, but I experimented with it. I took a filter, I'd lock the video, wait 5 seconds, (usually talk with voice changer) and let go on the video, and you can clearly see, the filter disappears on video.

I'll have to find the snap, but once I was being freaking stupid, for whatever reason, bouncing on my bed. And in the snap, literally say, “What the freak is that?” The Big Mouth filter made on half of my face, elongated? I'm not very sure how to explain it.

So, Snapchat on iPad is 4 stars for now.",6/5/20 14:46,0.05044566544566547,0.5014489214489214,positive

Also it would post my snap but then say it failed to post when I actually posted it. So I repost it and delete the other one and then moments go by and it shows that I posted the same thing twice?

One is the story viewing system is a little buggy. So I look at my story and it says 125 and the next one says 90 and the last one goes back on 125. Are people able to skip stories? And also it is showing that I didn’t view the story. Like when I open the story I’ll see it but it will appear that I haven’t opened it.

Also you should add a lot more cuter clothes like maybe some black shorts like athletic shorts and some other cute trendy clothes and add more cute jean shorts.  Also I would like to see some more things on snap and mabey take away the ss thing but only for chats to have it.  But add new clothes exesires and thing plsss.

It won’t let me click on anything and it’s just stuck there. I have to exit snapchat and reset it. This is very very annoying and I can never get any power ups or anything!!",6/15/19 12:55,0.26875000000000004,0.5791666666666667,positive

Camera is super zoomed for some reason and makes the quality look horrendous and grainy. From my understanding and other reviews, this has been a problem for months and they still haven’t fixed it, plain lazy. Also they added this feature about two weeks ago that showed you all your recently opened snaps when taking a picture and was super easy to reply to people instead of remembering who you needed to snap back. This was amazing and I gave this app 5 stars for it, but now they have randomly taken it away and gave no reason for it. Overall, disappointed.

You can not slide before opening a chat anymore which so many people do. Also I don't really like how the bar is on the bottom it just seems like you are copying instagram a little bit. Even though it seems like it's easier with the bar at the bottom, I like the old format better because it's whate everyone is used to and it's more unique. The only thing I like about this new snapchat update is the cool icons on snap maps. PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMAT OF SNAPCHAT!

And if I exit out, the story doesn’t disappear and go to the back of the line like usual, it’s just shows that I haven’t watched it. 2) Snap sometimes will have a glitch where I can’t send snaps and sometimes can’t view them. 3) There are times where snap will tell you someone is typing when they actually aren’t.

The only way it goes away is if i delete the app and then re download lt and have to log back in again. After a bit, the black screen appears again and I have to do it all over again.

1729,4,"I love snapchat! Before i got my phone i could never text my dad in any way shape or form, so i told my dad to download this so i could text him. Recently , i have noticed a few major bugs in the snapchat app. 

Here are 2 of the bugs i have noticed:

1. Sometimes after i post something on my story, the camera will always go half screen and zoomed in. So to fix this i have to close out of the app, shut my phone off, and then get back on it. 

2. When i want ti send a text message on snapchat, the keyboard will sometimes take up most of the screen and i cant see what i am typing. So i have to swipe in and out of the chat multiple times to fix this.

I hope you take this review into consideration and fix these major bug problems and fix them. It would make a snapchat experience better for everyone, who has all these problems.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and please fix these few problems!!",6/3/19 22:50,0.09734848484848485,0.2924242424242424,positive

Then last night I came home from the movies and I was about to check my Snapchat and once I clicked into the app it logged me out! I tried everything to try to fix it and it wouldn’t fix! I was super upset and frustrated ( not to mention that all my memories got lost) I’ve now made a new account and some people added me back while others didn’t. I’m still a little upset at Snapchat for this issue. So please try and fix this issue for the future snapchaters!

I use snapchat as a source of communication instead of texting, what’s app, direct message, etc., and generally I want to think about what I want to say before responding. I get quite anxious not knowing what I am going to read when opening a chat, which is why I have always loved the “chat” feature in snapchat; and being able to half swipe.

I went over in my head what I could have possibly done wrong. After many hours of trying to figure it out, I came to the conclusion that I had done nothing wrong. I had not violated anything. And a quick search shows that others had recently experienced the same thing. 

But without warning and no ability to get back in, I lost a few dozen people that I have no other way of contacting. Also gone are any memories and stories. You cannot contact anyone at snap. Emailing them is a waste of your time and sanity.

1 maybe add a horse racing or jumping one!

If you do the spotted make sure you look up the different Appaloosa coat patterns, they are cool! This would be awesome!!!

They have no customer service phone number so everytime i try to reach out i get the EXACT SAME MESSAGE. Even though i write in the help box that i keep getting the same message and keep asking them to contact me in a different way for more help and i repeatedly get told the same thing.

10,5,So I recently just got the current update of Snapchat and it myself as well as many people that I know don’t necessarily like it. It changes the flow a bit too much and there are now some features that don’t exist anymore. I do like being able to access the snap map better by clicking on it however I do not like that when I swipe to the left instead of opening a conversation it goes to the map. Many of us would rather be able to swipe into our conversations like we used to. I understand that the update was most likely a lot of work but I think it would be nice if we could get the option to decide if swiping left will open chats or the map. May be in a next update you can add in a feature in our settings where you can pick whether swiping left or open the map or your chats I’m sure many people would appreciate it although I do understand it would take a lot of work. Either way Snapchat is an amazing app and really this is just a small problem but one that I feel many people would appreciate having the choice about. Still putting five out of five stars though because despite the update I still love the app.,7/17/20 6:28,0.254,0.4835555555555555,positive
18,3,"You JUST updated the app after a whole day of the black screen issue, but the issue is still here, and I also can’t tap the icons on the bottom to transition from my snaps to my stories. Is this happening because of my device? Either way, please fix it because the update did not do anything. I’m also losing my streaks because of this issue, so when you eventually update this app again, please bring back the streaks that I supposedly “lost” just because of this ongoing issue. I also cannot reply to friends’ snaps with a snap of my own, because of the black screen issue. I can take the photo, but it only shows up after the photo is taken. Think of it like a Polaroid picture, where you have to wait for the image to show up after taking the photo. That is exactly what’s going on in general with the camera, but at least the photo immediately shows up after snapping your photo. Lastly, my friends’ Snapchat stories are starting to repeat themselves again, even when I have already viewed them. That needs to be taken care of, because that issue lasted AWHILE last time. I would also be open to share some newer ideas for the app; but for now these are the issues that I’m going to report on. Thank you.",7/14/20 14:44,0.0358974358974359,0.39615384615384613,negative
25,1,"This rating is based on the new update not on Snapchat in general. Lots of people including my wife and I do not like the new look, the old one was honestly easier to use as well. This update makes it too easy to swipe to the wrong part. This update is also insanely glitchy... it’s not letting me save videos sometimes, it’s crashing out and going to my phones home page making me reopen and lose where I was, and it’s notifying me I have pics and videos then when I click it takes up to a minute for that video or picture to actually come through??? It also changed the fact that you can swipe to chat without opening videos or pictures. When I’m in public I often open the chat before I open the whole chat often, almost every dingle time just to make sure there’s not a warning of needing or not needing sound or if my wife and I are chatting and sending videos simultaneously and I can’t open the videos at the time but still want to continue our chat conversation... it makes it impossible... it’s been VERY frustrating... truly haven't been a fan of the new update AT ALL... I read the recent reviews to see others thoughts, and I NEVER post my own, but this is something that needs to be heard... and I want to add to the number of complaints about this update. Please get the old snap back!!!!",7/27/20 6:42,0.030685111989459817,0.5435880544576197,positive
26,4,"I've had Snapchat for over 2 years now. Snapchat is a fun, creative way to express yourself and talk to friends or meet new people. Most people, including myself, will add people off of quick add. Sometimes these people will express and share unwanted and unnecessary opinions or show body parts, and Snapchat makes it easy to disconnect from these people by simply un-adding them. I haven't really had any problems with snap, except for one or two things that need to be fixed. Number one is the fact that when I send or receive streaks, that they will send or show twice, which is very annoying. Second, it glitches and tells me that I have to go back and re-add everyone that I have on snap because I don't have them added already. And last but not least, is that fact that sometimes it freezes when you try a filter on, or write something on a picture. These are small problems, but I'm not the only one experiencing these problems. Over all, Snapchat is a fun app with a good image. I wouldn't recommend letting anyone who isn't at least 12 have Snapchat. Thank you for your time. 🙌🏽♥️",7/16/20 0:46,0.08515151515151514,0.46058441558441554,trust
28,2,"i’ve had this app for the LONGEST time! but recently i have been having a HUGE problem. about 4-5 days ago my snapchat would not let me save any pictures because “i didn’t have enough storage”. i checked my storage and i definitely had enough. every time i tried to watch a story it would glitch to another one and wouldn’t even let me watch that one. everything took forever to send and my notifications for me receiving something came in later than they were supposed to ! so i tried to update it , that didn’t work. then i tried to log out so i could log back in to see if that would fix it. now it won’t even let me back in. it shows me in the camera but then it throws me out. some people i know have been dealing with this same problem as well. i’ve had someone else logging into my snap so they could send my streaks. i log into it every now and then off of someone else’s phone so that i can see what’s going on and watch people’s stories. i can’t delete apps on my phone because of a password my dad set and then forgot so there’s no way i can uninstall and then reinstall the app. snapchat i love you but fix yourself!!! please do it soon , all of my pictures and memories are on there , and that’s the only way i really talk to my friends.",7/28/20 17:46,0.13138020833333333,0.38125000000000003,anticipation
32,2,"I’ve been using SnapChat for several years. I’ve enjoyed it a lot, never encountering an issue. Then suddenly, things began to change over the past few weeks.
One night, I noticed that all of my Streaks had the time capsule next to them, indicating that they were about to end. So, I sent out Streaks to everyone, thus causing the time capsule to disappear and an extra day to be added to each Streak. When I woke up the next morning, approximately 9 hours later, all of my Streaks remained in tact except for one; my longest streak, spanning over 800 days plus. 
This is despite the fact that I sent out Streaks to everyone the night before, and all of the time capsules disappeared. Yet, just 1 Streak ended. The next day, both my friend (who I had the terminated streak with) and I filed reports through the app about the malfunction, but we’re left without a response. 
Since that day, I’ve encountered other issues such as the app crashing, Streaks failing to send despite having WiFi, and messages failing to send. I’m very disappointed in the malfunctioning of what was seemingly a reliable app for years, and the lack of customer service dealt to acknowledge my filed report. It would be upsetting if this went unnoticed, and a reliable user of an app was left dissatisfied.",7/15/19 0:24,-0.09705882352941177,0.2764705882352941,positive
43,3,"Snapchat, you know how you added the group chat system a while back? There needs to be one change to it. We should have the ability to remove someone from a group. Here’s why:

Okay, so, I decided that I wanted to make a group chat with my friends and use it to share stories as a way to get closer. I made the mistake of inviting one friend, however, as she would make the most ridiculous and inconvenient calls in the middle of the night. Not only that, but, she wasn’t using the system of MY chat as I intended. She abuses my group chat as she posts multiple pictures, despite me asking her to stop. That friend later says I yelled at her, then creates drama for everyone and keeps us all up in the middle of the night. That girl later posts something I call very disturbing, and the sad things are, for one, I couldn’t delete it, and the fact people were literally online, on my group chat, and saw that. Now what are they gonna think of me? I’ve had enough of it to the point I left the group chat. I got fed up, ok?

Snapchat, PLEASE make this change right now, and I’ll give you a five star rating. Thanks for your time in reading this (if you did so already).",7/29/19 4:39,-0.005423280423280419,0.4297619047619048,trust
54,2,"I usually don’t do reviews, but I’m really starting to get annoyed with the “next page” “next page” next page” “next page” “next page” story pages. The stories are really interesting, but eventually I will click next page and for some reason the page will just glitch and show a white page or pop up an ad that I can’t get out of except to press the “x” and after that, I don’t feel like scrolling all the way through the numerous “next page” buttons and ads, and therefore cannot finish the story that had already hooked my attention and I was almost done with.  It’s been doing this for about a year or more. Eventually I just don’t even want to read the stories that writers spent their time writing. I have an iPhone XR and I am connected to internet that has never gave me any issues. Plus, like I said.. it has been going on for a long while now and I’ve been on numerous devices and connected to numerous WiFi connections. That said, the problem is most definitely stemming from the application.

55,1,"I love the primary function of Snapchat. But there should be options to customize a feed. For instance, some people (although I’ve never met them) probably like official stories and enjoy seeing them. Someone like me who hates official stories and thinks that they are biased, misleading, complete wastes of time and that they lower millions of IQs every day, would appreciate an option to hide all official stories because I don’t care about celebrities, crazy people seeking validation or loudmouths trying to get my attention. I just want to communicate with my friends. You might respond “oh, you can hide stories you don’t like”. Well I tried hiding all stories I don’t like but more kept popping up in the “Discover” section, stories that I hated even more. Just make an option to hide official stories, it’s that simple. I’m talking an option to completely hide them from the app. I think I’ll probably delete Snapchat sooner if nothing changes and I hope you realize it’s a shame that you’re indoctrinating young people like me with the most mind-numbing, useless content around. On a positive note, you do have at least one good official story: “Snapped in the Wild”. Who cares about some brainless instagram model when you can watch animals rip each other to shreds.

(btw I have more than 3 friends) Please fix this! Second, (this is not a bug but an issue) whenever I delete a chat it says ""YOU DELETED A CHAT"" and it gives me anxiety. Please remove this when you remove a chat. (I don’t mind the part that notifies my friend I deleted a chat) I just want the feature when I delete a chat this pops up on the chat. I don’t mind that the fact it notifies the person I deleted the chat. I want this to be removed, cuz it gives me stress and I am an organized person.

I'm bulimic and have body dysmorphia so I asked Snapchat to stop showing me ads for fat reduction treatments and they emailed me back saying I could disable a certain setting and that's all I could do. Doing this had no impact on the ads they were showing me. Snapchat also advertises scam businesses that have you send money for a product then never send the product and refuse to take any calls or emails. Snapchat does not check out the ads they show on their site and result in people getting scammed and having worsened mental health and confidence. If you have mental health issues or body dysmorphia, Snapchat is not the app for you it is not safe at all. They will lock your account after giving you a warning even if you stop doing what you were doing before. They don't make the terms very clear without reading a ridiculous amount of stuff and then penalize you after reading it and following the rules.

I like to save everyone I post into one story for each day and there’s no easy way to do it. There should be a way to set a time of time to be automatically saved in one story together like 9am to 5pm or 11am to 9pm or maybe if one story ends and then a large group of snaps are posted before that first snap is to expire there needs to be a way to get a notification from SC itself that ask if you want to save the latest set of post to a story before they disappear from existence",7/26/19 4:51,0.14349876314162024,0.3910559678416821,positive

Every update it just the app just gets better and better. I also like this app because if you run out of storage on your phone you can save the images and always have them as memories. If you have younger siblings and don’t have a way to communicate through the phone this app is here to help. You can create your own filters, save images, call, text, and a lot more... if you want the opportunity to make nice new friends then this is the app for you.

No. Still cant do that. Then I went through my entire snap list to open them and reply to them when I can’t even reply to certain people’s snaps!!! It won’t let me open them.

285,5,ok so i’ve had my snapchat for about three years now and i love it so much and i’ve never had a problem with it. but recently i updated snapchat and there is a little black bar at the bottom or the screen and i hate it so much i liked the one before that because it was so much better. also i think that no one wants to see unexpected nudity because it is very disrespectful to the people who didn’t ask or say they don’t want that. i think that there should be a little warning sign on the snap that has nudity so that you don’t open it and see something you don’t want to because it very nasty. also if your reading this and you do that please stop because that is so disrespectful and rude. but anyways i recommend this app but also stay safe and use it wisely!,7/20/20 4:36,0.08518518518518518,0.5601851851851851,positive

Back in the day it was cool to have a high score but now people who have high scores are roasted & called out all the time. It shouldn’t be anyone’s business what my score is. Especially when I’m trying to ghost someone / leave them on delivered. I know they are watching my snap-score to see if it goes up. I do it myself to other people but I think it’s best that we just remove it completely for the better good of everyone’s mental health. This may sound crazy but THIS IS A REAL THING.  So many crazy teenage girls do this to the guy they like, he’s using ghosting them playing 2k and they will take a pic with the last 3 digits of the score draw , then save to the memories for a tiktok.

A key feature is that these “snaps” is that they are automatically deleted once they have been viewed by the recipient. This allows for anonymous messaging, although both parties have the option to save messages or pictures. The opposite party will receive a notification that the snap was saved.

Just sayin’. 
However, a couple years ago they added a section  which is called “Discover” in which you will find snap “stories” from celebs, pop media platforms, news and social media “influencers.” That defeats the whole purpose of this app for me which is having a social media app that’s somewhat private to keep up with people I actually know. The barrage of advertisements and the discover section full of random crap sort of ruins it for me.

The app only acts up when your  WiFi or phone device/ service isn’t working. Meaning it’s not the apps issue, its your issue. 
Never had one issue the whole 8 years I’ve had this app. But you can only set your user name once, so don’t make it funny or inappropriate or something embarrassing 🤣❤️ you’ll be stuck with it forever unless you make a new one. 
There’s many cool features, yes this app shares your location but you can TURN IT OFF. 
There’s a new feature where you can find someone without sending them your location, it’s like a compass, I personally love it because I can find my friends without having to FaceTime them several times to see where they’re at when they don’t know themselves. 
You can post something without someone seeing it if you want. 
Personally this is a perfect app for 13+ they decided who they want to talk to unlike Facebook where they can still see and receive messages from strangers.

#1. getting to pick our bestfriends list
now i understand that the point of a bestfriends list is to organize who you snap the most outs of anyone on your snap but I have had people show up on my bestfriends list that I hardly snapped. I have lots of people on my snap but I would like there to be a way to have my close friends and then a few others in the list. The process could be as easily as adding a new tab like pin conversation but it’s pin bestfriend and then you select what place you want the list to go in. 

#2 streaks button 
Snapchat could automatically have a button that calculates who all you have a streak with and it would send your streaks to all those people making it easier to keep your streaks and less emails to y’all of people asking you to reset their streaks because they lost them. 

#3 how many snaps you send to one person 
on your friends profile I think you should be able to see how many snaps you have sent them for that day.",7/9/20 19:46,0.2009469696969697,0.39551767676767674,positive

But the down part is that I don’t like there new update that has come out and I want the old one back but idk how! Snapchat ppl who made the app pls answer my questions, how can you get the old update back? 

But if you don’t have snap and are reading the reviews it is totally worth it! It’s so much fun and I luv it! If you have other social media like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok & Instagram than they would kind of all have one thing in common! Social media is very social you get to meet new ppl and things but can also be dangerous so I would make sure you ur your child has social media to check them.

Snapchat is worth it, there’s this thing called bitmoji and it’s basically your emoji on what ppl see! You can confirm ppl to be friends you can save chats you can FaceTime or call! You can do so much on here! See other story’s and stuff it’s amazing! You don’t need to show your face on your profile like most social media’s do! That’s one of the good things!

At first I thought a couple of them had removed me as a friend but that didn’t make sense because it is different friends everyday that this happens to and the first ones that I couldn’t see the stories of would let me see them this time and so on. It’s starting to get frustrating. I do understand you need time to fix the right problems though.

690,3,So personally i love snapchat and ive had it for years but lately it has been glitching a lot for me. the camera picture doesn’t show up when i go to take a snap and it shows just a black screen but after pressing the button the picture of what was in the screen shows up. it doesn’t let me view people’s stories and some of my snaps i’ve received and OPENED days ago come back as if i haven’t opened them. when i go to click on a person so i can look at their profile it doesn’t come up and i lost half my streaks after sending them but they failed to send after telling me they went through. i’ve talked to many other people about this and they are also experiencing this. if anyone has any advice on what to do please help.,7/15/20 4:25,-0.03229166666666666,0.371875,trust
692,2,"I’ve used SC for a long while and have had few complaints (although the stories page is too cluttered with news/ads). However, recently I’ve sometimes tried to open the app, and all I see is a black screen with the “take picture” circular button for several seconds, and then it is a black screen with a grey bar along the top of the screen. I’ve tried restarting, reinstalling the app, etc. and have only found success in being able to open the app a couple of times, both times after reinstalling. I can’t help but think this is a backwards compatibility issue due to my slightly outdated iOS version. If that’s the case, that’s too bad because I suspect Apple’s newest iOS is too demanding for my phone!

I can’t even view the stories I’m subscribed to without them automatically opening them and become impossible to close (a glitch) unless I force close & reopen the app. My friends have taken a look at the layout from my phone and hate the layout as much as me and keep telling me that they’re lucky theirs hasn’t changed.

716,1,I’ve been with Snapchat before filters and when you had to pay to use a replay. This app over the years has gotten terrible. I shouldn’t have to be forced to watch a ad to watch the news. This actually used to be a good app. I used to really enjoy it but now I’m deleting app. Instagram stories are sooo much better. I hope the creators read this and change the app to what it was before. I’m really happy that a lot of celebrities use Instagram stories more. Just REALLY shows how bad this app has gotten. Younger generations will never know what this app used to be. Oh and btw I payed for two filters back when you had to pay for them and the filters don’t show up anymore! May have only been two dollars but that was two dollars I could’ve used on something else. Thanks for wasting my money snapchat. Hope this app changes or gets taken off the App Store completely.

766,1,i love snapchat it’s a fun and fast way to text friends snap your friends and to share pics form an event. there are so many things you can do on this app which is great but there are some things that need to be fixed. many times while i was on the app it logged me out all of a sudden also i don’t open streaks and when i logged back in my notifications went from 86 to 45 which is ridiculous. also sometimes when i check my phone and see i have a text and i usually just open it the next day but then it tells me that there were not texts and that i already opened it even tho i didn’t. also i send stark’s about three times a day and when i have a streak with someone sometimes the timer thing shows up and i know that i am not the one who needs to send a snap since i do every few hours but then i send them a snap anyway and the timer goes away which is so weird .there are many times were u have to rewatch stories tons of times. these problems don’t make me want to use the app but i still do since i text my friends on it. these problems should we fixed because i know a bunch of friends that experience these problems and who knows hundreds of other users may too. for a better experience snapchat please update the app and fix these problems,7/11/19 13:14,0.11388888888888886,0.44642857142857134,trust
776,3,"Snapchat is a great way to talk with friends, but there’s is some improvements i would recommend. 1. Snapchat should let us change our usernames at anytime whenever we would like to change it. 2. They should disable the notification that someone screenshots the chat/conversation. 3. They should make “Team Snapchat” answer the text messages if it only is for a question or help about the app, if not “Team Snapchat” a way to talk to someone for help in need with the app. 4. Make new stuff involving the chat, like uncommon games ur uncommon stuff. And for last they should let login to various devices at once. All of these things and other people ideas would make a huge improvement in this app! Thank you!

791,2,"So, usually I never tend to have a problem with updates, I just ignore them and figure out how to go about the new ‘interface’. But this update is absolutely HORRID. Instead of being able to scroll on the stories/discover page now, you are immediately slapped with some random story from a discover page or whatever. It’s obnoxious, and harsh to work with. On top of this, the map was removed from the ‘middle’ of the snap screen, so you have to swipe all the way to the left; or use the ugly little icon bar at the bottom. You also can’t swipe into chats like you used to, so if you’re someone with small hands who relies on swiping and little gestures to operate, now you’re screwed!

819,1,People use snapchat for the social aspect. The majority of users do not touch their subscriptions or the for you page. So why did you think it was a good idea to make those features take up the entire screen on two different pages. And you shoved the only thing people care about (their friend’s story) into a sliver of the screen. It’s so tiny and makes no sense why you have the subscriptions and for you page twice when no one cares about them. Make people’s story much much larger because this was a long time coming. At least keep the articles on the page all the way to the right where it won’t bother anybody. You have to fix this because this bothers so many people and it is driving people away from snap.

But now I get on Snapchat (an app that I’ve used since it came out and felt so safe on) to have fun and try out different filters just to be left feeling even more insecure about myself since nearly every filter altered the shape of my nose, nostrils and the bridge of my nose to be smaller.

I’m about to get on and take pictures to compare, and I will gladly send them to the Snapchat team AND make a tweet about it to my thousands of followers to let them know how disgusting and humiliating this is.

1. after making a private story, the private story should remain as a story option unless deleted. It seems like if I don't use my private story at least once a week, it disappears and I have to go through my contacts and click on everyone I want to be able to view it again
2. We should be able to search a famous person's name and have their Snapchat pop up. This only happens for a few people as of right now. 
3. Sometimes I have to push the center circle repeatedly to finally snap a picture, and as a result I end up missing the moment. Should be an easy fix, just running a bit slow.
4. When people you are “subscribed to” post something on their story we can’t see if it’s from their memories or a year ago for ex

I’ve lost best friend tags and other tags because while everyone else is still snapping away, I send maybe 2 snaps if I ll lucky. 

I’ve tried closing the app and reopening it, logging out and back in, restarting my phone, resetting my network settings and reinstalling the app and nothing works. I’ve also tried contacting snapchat to no prevail which leaves me to this review. There have been several “updates” since this started happening but I literally don’t think they do anything. 

I haven’t lost my main streaks and I can still receive snaps which is the only reason it has 2 starts Instead of 1. 

Who knows, maybe a bad review will help bring it to light and it will get fixed faster ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",7/9/20 13:13,0.017307692307692316,0.4391025641025642,positive
1049,3,When going to take a picture or a video the screen goes black not able to see what the camera is focused on with the front or back camera. After the picture is been taken or the video is done I can see what the image is. I tried logging out of Snapchat that didn’t work I tried resetting my iPhone that didn’t work. The only thing that I was able to do to fix the issue was to delete the app for at least an hour and re-download it. I thought it was fixed two days later The same thing happens again only way to fix this issue is to continue deleting the app and downloading it after about an hour.

1105,1,"Before, Snapchat’s layout of the stories of everyone you added made sense; they were listed so you would be able to find them easily. And also, you could easily find and edit your own story.

I got an email basically saying my account was “locked”, and they provided a link to recover it - it didn’t work. I reached out to Snapchat and they said my account had been deleted/terminated for “violating terms of service”. I read through the ToS and I didn’t violate a single thing. 

4 years of my life erased, and Snapchat won’t give me a reason for why my account got deleted. They must have a messed up algorithm for detecting bots, because this has happened to other people too. Other people have had their accounts suddenly deleted for no reason.

The thing I really like it that it says if you friend read it or not. Not all apps can do that! I think the filters are great and amazing they are always cool or pretty.

Make it to where you can edit stories even though you’ve already posted them, and give snapchat a feature where you can search music and play it in the background similar to Instagram. The message notifications are a bit slow as is ability for the system to register if I've seen a story or not.

The second one, I’ll open Snapchat and it will be completely black with a white, thick line at the top.
I can’t fix this one is by closing the app and re-opening it because when I reopen it, it does the exact same thing. The only way I can fix this is by uninstalling the app together and reinstalling it, which is really annoying.

For you to promote this sentiment is beyond unfair to them, it’s beyond unfair to Americans whom YOU ARE DIVIDING by spreading this sentiment (with upside down American flags? Really?).

1926,2,I have used Snapchat since it first came out. I enjoyed the new approach of having pictures disappear it made it very fun. Over the past few years the app has evolved to a form of media. This could’ve been a good thing but instead the media that is presented is of pop culture and stuff that I don’t see as important. I really don’t care what Kim K. Eats for breakfast that kind of stuff. I really wish there were more science related news stories or even stories about kids that are changing the world right now. Even maybe how to speak a new language just overall educational pieces instead of the pop culture fluff that is seen all the time.

There are websites to hack snap now and more accounts are getting hacked. I have had my account for a year now and had my phone number saved as my back up to get into the account. My account was hacked and the person is using my account to harass people and send threats acting as me. I tried to get the account back but everything was changed. I emailed the snap team and they said they couldn’t do anything bc the email was changed!!!

4. and eraser button for the drawing tab: whenever i wanna draw something on my snap i accidentally mess up at first and don’t realize it and i make the rest good and now i have to undo the whole thing and start over and its really annoying.
5. a feature where it doesn’t show that you screenshoted: i have so many problems with this bcuz it just causes more drama when me or any of my friends screenshots something and after they do we’re just like:??.

   I think your app is wonderful, no real complaints to give. I’ve been using snapchat for about 6 years now, it’s the only social media I have and I’ve gained quite a big following on it.

    Gaining this big following has also helped me realize that most of the people that I have added into my friends list I don’t actually know! And being able to multi select users on the list will be so much faster and easier than going down the list one by one.

11,5,"I can say confidently that me and all of my friends spend just about all of our time on Snapchat. It has brought many people I know together in ways I’ve never seen capable by another app. By far snapchat is my favorite and most used app. It is easy to use and has a smooth and appealing layout. I am not here to criticize, but simply to make a suggestion. I enjoy watching some of the shows on the “For you” tab. But I often find myself losing the show that I was just watching. I’ve noticed that thumbnails change after you go through the story, so that makes it hard to find what you clicked on in the first place. In particular I keep finding myself thinking “wow, I enjoyed that show, but I don’t remember what channel it was under. Though I only watched it 5 minutes ago.” Thus I would propose a sort of “history” feature for the “for you” page. (I would not like this for personal stories, only shows on the for you tab.) Possibly even just keep it in a more hidden spot because I do not need it as often as other things on Snapchat. But a feature like this would help me find and subscribe to the shows I enjoy.

HOWEVER. when i am going absolutely OFF in a snapchat video to send to the group chat, the last thing i need is the third snap to be sent first, then the first, then the fifth, etc. I just want the snaps to be sent in order, otherwise the purpose is defeated. I’ve seen a “waiting to send” text pop up recently, but i don’t think it’s waiting to send the second snap after the first. it’s just waiting to send the next collection of videos (because let’s face it, I send like five minutes of videos). It’s great for communication with my friends, but not when the first snap that loads is sent out of order. no one knows what i’m talking about. the whole premise of snapchat is photos and videos, but it seems the app is more focused on news stories and weird emojis. I can get news anywhere, preferably anywhere but snapchat. I just want my videos sent in order. Great app idea, but it’s getting ruined by all the new options. Please perfect the thing that made everyone get the app in the first place before you add new mechanics.

76,5,"Hello! I totally love  snapchat, it's a great way to communicate with friends and people in general, and a great way to meet new people, but there IS a small feature you can add. So basically, in order to screenshot the chat, you have to request to the person. For example, if I were talking to my friend and wanted to screenshot the chat, I would screenshot but before it adds to my camera roll my friend gets a request asking if I can screenshot the chat. EX: Emily has requested to screenshot this chat! ) And I have another recommendation, we should be able to organize our memories category. For example, you can add a section named anything you desire that will be at the top and you can add or remove any photos, like an album, and we can also have shared albums with friends too that you can invite friends to share an album with selected memories and others you add to the story can add their own memories too.

Snapchat, I don’t know what the issue is, but I would like to enter my “My Eyes Only” with my password.

I have emailed snapchat and gone through all the (LIMITED) available venues to contact them, with no help at all whatsoever. although I love snapchat, I am giving the app 1 star because of the lack of justice and “snapchat support” that I have experienced.

Snapchat locked my account without a warning & without an explanation... I’ve tried everything that I can possibly do on my end and nothing is working!! I am convinced that maybe someone reported my account and had gotten me blocked from Snapchat! (Or they could’ve been trying to log into my account) I am supposed to receive text messages and emails when someone accessed my account and I haven’t received any notifications, so it was safe to assume that my account wasn’t compromised... my next guess was that Snapchat blocked my account or locked it because none of their suggestions per the help link is working.... this is very frustrating seeing as I did not break any rules and i do not spam Snapchat... they literally blocked my account for no apparent reason...

Another glitch I have is with my snaps I felt like I was getting less Snapchat’s than normal so I start look to see that people were leaving me on delivered for days it said then I clicked on and I would just get there snap from 3 days ago. I’ve asked my friends on there thoughts about Snapchat and they also said that they felt like the app has been declining lately as of the recent months.

2. Be able to see when people are active even if they dont have their location turned on. Dont really have a reason... i just love on instagram when I can see whos active and who will respond to me when im bored lol.

I’m super creative so I spend my time added fun designs with the pen tool (love the color variety options!), stickers, filters, and gifs. I often find ways to start funny picture wars between my friends so we can laugh at ourselves because of how much fun we’re having. I would love to be able to promote digital artists on this platform by being able to send their Snapchat collaborated sticker packs around. Win-win for Snapchat and the art community.

*add sticker packs to Snapchat memories? What correlation the sticker pack made what effect on that day to you? #ThrowbackStickerPackFeature

i have an old account that i log back into every so often to see if i have a “year ago from today” memory pop up. every time i log out of my new account, though, all of my stickers that i have saved (like the ones you can add to your pictures) disappear, which is actually really frustrating to me. 

my only other annoyance is that whenever i log out, the new update goes away. now i know a lot of people HATE the new update, but i love it and i hate that it keeps just disappearing :/",8/28/20 16:53,-0.00583778966131906,0.5983511586452763,trust

If they didn’t kick you off when another device logs in this wouldn’t be as big of an issue. Since I was kicked, i have no way to log back in because my email and phone number were changed so I can’t reset my password. In addition, once my snap was hacked, the person had my person information and proceeded to log into VARIOUS other accounts of mine the entire remainder of the day. This was all a chain that happened AFTER my snap was hacked.

I was going through my camera roll today and deleting things that I didn’t want anymore.  I accidentally deleted something that I still wanted and now I can’t get it back.  I’ve been trying to do everything and I can’t get my deleted snapchats back and it’s devastating.  I’ve been trying to do everything but my deleted memories are gone.  If somebody knows how to get them back please tell me.  It would be very much appreciated.  When I was deleting some memories that I didn’t want, Snapchat kept crashing.

I want the old snapchat, just sending pictures and videos and chats. It’s a shame that the app is so optimized to all of this extra crap now. It can’t even send 1 minutes worth of video without freezing up and taking forever. What a shame this app has become. Thanks for ruining what used to be everyone’s favorite social application. My longest streak is currently 1838, I have used snapchat every day for as long as I can remember. The only reason I’m still using it is because there is nothing else like it. But I guess you people at Snap Inc know that though. Why change our poorly performing app if people will stick with it just because there’s nothing else like it to go to?

649,1,"I’ve had issues with this app since I first downloaded it on my new phone. First off, with every Snapchat video I try to record, there’s a little stutter/freeze in the beginning and this issue never occurs with the actual native iPhone camera app... Absolutely annoying how it affects all the videos that I send out and doesn’t go away even after resetting my phone multiple times and clearing all caches. 

Secondly, the zoom in and blurry photos are terrible and have been an ongoing issue on this app for months. I’m not sure if the developers are working on it or do not find it much of a problem to fix, but I hope they find a way to resolve it soon.

Thirdly, the app randomly force closes on its own despite the fact that I have plenty of ram, storage, and power on my phone. This one is probably the least annoying problem I’m dealing with, and I truly hope the developers work on these issues!",8/28/19 3:04,-0.16257102272727275,0.4693813131313132,negative

Another issue I have is when you delete a chat is says “You (or whoever) deleted the chat”. Why is this a feature? Sometimes you might regret sending something and delete it and others become curious about what you sent. One last thing that I don’t understand is screenshots.

1016,3,I’ve had this app for over a year and it hasn’t seem to give me any problems up until the last month or so. It has continuously kicked me out of the app. It won’t load old messages like they arnt there at all. If I close the app and re open in while I’m having a conversation sometimes it will skip back in the chat and show me a screen that makes it appear that chats we sent an hour ago were the last chats that were sent when we had been talking the whole time. I was having a conversation with my friend on snap and I closed it for a second and re opened it. It showed that I had left her on open for one day.

1324,3,I have read your reviews and now I know why you aren’t closer to 5 stars. Why do you put out an app that’s fun but can’t fix the issues. I have sent several tickets to fix the clear search cache and no response and it’s still the same. As one other person wrote you have no customer support section. So I’m gonna try this before I delete the app and find something better. I never use the search cache but every time I go to clear all cache or do it separate it always leaves a number one. I don’t understand why you have it there if your not going to fix it. All others work fine so why not that’s one.

Now it takes so long to deliver things, the cameos didn’t work for a few months until a recent update, and it takes a while to load the app. I especially don’t like how everyone has different versions, it’s very confusing. My version has the map, conversations, camera, stories, and videos buttons at the bottom. Before, the box containing these buttons was transparent but you could still see it, now it isn’t transparent at all and if I take a picture I don’t see the button of my screen.

Then when I open it, I have to refresh the page to show that I have new snaps. Very aggravating. Also, the other day when I updated the app, I noticed that my snapstreak of 563 with my boyfriend had reset— not the only snapstreak I have but was the only one to reset🙄.

I was Snapchatting my boyfriend and he didn’t answer for 2 hours but he was on Snapchat because I could see his snapmap. I texted him thinking that he was just ignoring me but it was doing the exact same for him. He said that he sent me 20 messages because he was getting mad I didn’t answer him. So I did the obvious thing which was for both of us to log out. Nothing happened so we both deleted the app. Nothing happened. Now I’m getting old snaps from him that were from this morning and it’s still not even sending mine or his current snaps.

One of my favorite features that they took away a long time ago was the “best friends” feature. It basically lets your followers know who have been the top 3 that you’ve snapped to the most. These past two years I have been on & off in deleting my Snapchat because of the unnecessary updates. The only reason why i keep coming back is because of the camera & filters.

              This app is a great way to communicate with friends and family. Also, it can be a way to interact with new people. Every time I go on the app I have a great time with my friends. Some of the filters can make you look super cute, too. I love to communicate with some of best friends. And we are always laughing and having fun with the filters. I think it’s a really tun app, but it does have its features. Like, if you have to many pictures in your camera roll it won’t allow you to save any pictures which is really stupid. But, you do learn to deal with it and it turns out to be pretty ok in the end. Other than that if your storage isn’t full than the app is really good and you will have nothing to worry about.

2422,1,"I’m going to give my two cents like everyone else. I have had my account since late 2012, so longer than 6 and a half years. I logged out of Snapchat on 8/1 to try and fix an issue of my snaps not sending. I logged back in and it said my account was temporarily locked.

Of course I found out I only have to wait 24 hours then unlock it and I’m good. Well as everyone knows, it just re locks it as soon as you log in. I can’t make a new account or anything. Literally zero customer service. 6 and a half years of constant use and I can’t get an ounce of help.

I downloaded my data to figure out when I joined, and I also checked that this account had been reported one time for god knows what reason back in mid 2017, so two years ago.

If I don’t regain access to my account I’m going to be furious as I think everyone else will be. The robots literally send the exact same automated response, and responses from the Snapchat support twitter are also automated and useless. Please for the love of god get it together.

Also the glitches are pretty bad. I have 2 accounts and they can’t seem to separate correctly, contacts get added from one account to the other and then disappear. Stories show watched on one and the other.

I’ve had Snapchat for over 4 years now, and this is the worst update by far, the format is completely different and way more complicated. We use to be able to open a message with sliding our finger across the person name, but now when we slide it bring us to snap maps, leaving us to tap the message instead of being able to slide. The benefits of sliding is if we are able to slide we are able to have a peak at the message before we fully open it, so if someone is bothering and you don’t want to respond, or you’re ghosting someone you were able to read their messages without them knowing. Because of this update people who has been using Snapchat for years has to get use to tapping instead of sliding. Also I preferred if snap maps didn’t have its own page, and it was like it was previously, where you can pinch your fingers on the camera to access snap maps. And the final problem is at the bottom there are 4 icons, as if it wasn’t clear before on the purpose of these things, it makes it looks very Androidy and unprofessional.

Snap has a lot of features that are completely useless. The games? Little icons that show up on certain locations on the map? Stories you can subscribe to? Endless amounts of filters?

I have lost all of my streaks due to this app crashing and its very frustrating i love my streaks and im disappointed in the app. I love snapchat its my favorite app on my phone but as of right now its the crappiest app on my phone. I updated it and was a little iffy on if i wanted to update it only because my bestfriend is having the same issue she had hers set up to automatically update her apps and hers has been crashing since the day it updated. As soon as i open the app it and go to send a snapchat its freezes up and then the screen goes black and it takes me back to my home screen...not only that but it logs me out of my account out of nowhere i changed the password thinking someone else was logging in mine but thats not it... it still logs me out. Not to mention The new icon is too bold and ugly now. ive had snapchat since 2013 and ive only had one other issue with an update untill now. Can you please fix this issue i know im not the only person thats having this problem. Thank you",9/1/19 15:30,-0.015178829107400538,0.6150123685837972,negative
73,1,"I have been using Snapchat for years, I love using it as another way to keep in touch with my friends and family. Snap stories are great ways to show current events in your life without creating a post like other social media applications. 

So now for the ugly...

In December of last year, I rewarded myself with an upgrade of an iPhone 11 Pro from an 8 Plus. After a storage upgrade, this phone cost me well over $1,200. The greatest feature of the 11 Pro? The amazing, triple-lens camera. At events and gatherings, my phone is the phone of choice for taking pictures. As it should be. The camera on this phone is truly amazing. Apple hit the nail on the head with the triple lens camera. What isn’t amazing? The fuzzy, grainy photos that Snapchat creates with the 11 Pro camera. Looking at the screen before taking a picture, the quality doesn’t look bad, but once the shutter is pressed and the photo is taken, the exposure automatically jumps high, makes blacks in the image appear grey and grainy. The photo looks like the result of an iPod Touch 4th generation camera using Snapchat. NOT GOOD. SNAPCHAT, PLEASE FIX THIS. CONSUMERS PAY GOOD MONEY FOR THEIR PHONES WITH GREAT CAMERAS AND AN APP BASED ON SENDING AND RECEIVING PHOTOS SHOULD NOT BE SUCH TERRIBLE QUALITY.",9/16/20 17:16,0.1509649122807018,0.616578947368421,positive
83,3,"90% of subscription stories are the epitome of click bait garbage clearly added as a way to shove more ads down the users’ throats. God help you if you want to actually read any of the the linked articles within subscription stories. I have yet to encounter one that doesn’t feature buggy, paginated sites with ads between every 150 words. Oh wait, what’s that? You actually made it to the end of the article wading through ad after ad to get the last page to see what the title is mentioning? And.... It’s more click bait! But seriously, the quality of some of the stuff on discover is just atrocious and the click bait level is off the charts. Obviously you can just ignore discover all together, but the concept is pretty cool, and there’s a lot of potential there. It’s just a real shame that it’s filled with nonsense.

It makes me look pale and it lowers the quality of the pictures to look blurry. Also, videos are very glitchy, you can see literal squares and pixels on the screen! This has been happening to me and all of my friends. It is really affecting my enjoyment of Snapchat because I used to chat with my friends all the time, but now I don’t even care to go on because of the disappointing update. It also has a weird bar on the bottom and the snap map is on a page instead of being accessible by swiping down on the camera screen. The bar blocks part of the screen so I can’t see part of the pictures that I take or snaps that I receive. I’ve contacted Snapchat multiple times about the issues with this update in hopes that they would listen to their supporters and change things back to how it used to be, but I haven’t heard anything or seen any changes.

Before it was much nicer when you could just scroll down and look at it. I don’t think snapmaps needs its own tab on the menu bar thing. Snapchat just disorganized now. Additionally, there is this button that I’ve always hated since they added. The button which I’m referring to is when you make a snapchat, if you press that button it will automatically add to your story without asking you. The amount of times I’ve accidentally hit that button and posted something on my story that I didn’t want to post is crazy. Get rid of that button. There’s no purpose for it. It does the same function as if someone was to go next then press “add to story”. And at least if someone does it that way, it decreases the chances of posting something on their story that they didn’t mean to post.

I like Snapchat, and I used to use it all the time. However, there is one thing that with my current usage of it I have deemed is so annoying. I cannot stand the best friends feature. If you asked me before I had those little pink hearts with someone for over a year, I would have said this didn’t matter to me, I rarely interacted with it because my best friend didn’t ever match up; it always changed. However, I kept my pink hearts with someone for over a year and then a friend of mine snapped me so much that we lost it. Now we have to start all over. 

I know in the long run this is meaningless but I really think you would get better feedback from long time users if you could set your own best friends or something. This feature is annoying and honestly just stressful.",9/14/20 22:23,0.22916666666666666,0.5380952380952382,positive
181,1,"Okay, don't get me wrong i absolutely loveeeee snapchat!! Overall the app is my favorite social media app, but this week I got locked out of my snapchat account. It happened about three days ago. Whenever i got temporarily locked out, obviously I was curious why this would have happened bc i didn't do anything wrong. So I went to the website and figured it was probably because i didn't verify my email or phone number. They said it should unlock in 24 hours. It's been way over 24 hours and it STILL won't unlock. I've tried emailing team snapchat multiple times and tried unlocking it through the website multiple times. Now all of my memories, friends, and saved chats on that account are most likely gone forever if snap doesn't unlock my account. I am beyond frustrated and would really appreciate if somebody could show me how to unlock it or if team snapchat could kindly unlock it themselves. Moral of the story, verify your stupid email on snapchat or else they will lock you out of your account and lie about how long you'll be locked out.",9/13/20 22:38,-0.00021929824561402628,0.5377192982456142,trust

So I go to the site and try to fix it. I also click “unlock” to unlock my account. (On the site). And when I do it says “unable to request” or something. So I have no way of unlocking my account. I read the reasons why my account my be locked. Let me just say none of those things has/have happened in the past few months. I was just on Snapchat earlier today and it was fine. I don’t have any third party apps as well. I deleted bitmoji thinking that might be why and tried again. Still doesn’t work.

ADVICE: I suggest not turning on your location. People who you add can view where you are at any time. It can be really creepy, and I just don’t see the point in this feature.

In their latest update, they changed the entire layout of the app and made it less visually appealing, more glitchy, and just all around worse. My use of this app has steadily declined in recent months and this is the breaking point. The simplicity of using the app was one of the many nice things about it and that has been taken away. With each new update, the layout gets worse and worse and this time they have taken it too far. The developers downgrade their own app on a consistent basis and comes off almost like they want to see their app fail. To the developers : stop fixing stuff that is not broken, you are only making things worse. The old saying “ if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it “ applies nicely in many instances and this is no exception. Revert the app to the old layout.

388,3,"I remember when Snapchat used to keep up with features but now it seems all over the place. Feature requests seem to not be something that the company is looking at. For instance, Dark Mode arrived in iOS 13.0. We are now in iOS 14.0 and still there is no dark mode feature. 

A big one has been the camera quality. Snapchat doesn’t actually use the camera on our phones, it just takes screenshots and recordings. This forces me to open the native camera app, take a photo, then upload which is work that doesn’t need to be done. Instagram and Facebook both use the actual camera for beautiful and quality photos/videos. It makes the memory lasts. Nobody wants to look back at a memory in a year and see it blurry. 
*Im a current iPhone 11 Pro Max User.

Also, after 3 years of the “Redesign” it still hasn’t grown on me and it makes me not watch my friends stories especially due to the algorithm. When “Recently Updated” was a thing it not only reached more people but increased my usage on the app. I do use the app a lot and post often but these are requests that users have been making for years.

The overall performance of the app is great and runs smoothly on the other hand. It’s a pretty fast and reliable app to use and still fun just missing a lot of which could make it better.",9/26/20 7:59,0.14565217391304347,0.41630434782608694,positive

The company has sent me automated replies saying they are working on the issue but then I never hear back. They have no way to talk to anyone over the phone even for an issue as serious as this one.

404,1,"I would like to have a talk with the boneheaded developer who suggested this update. There was absolutely zero reason to change what was working and make it so disgusting. The app is not nearly as smooth as it used to be, I can’t peak at messages that I don’t want to respond to, and I cannot stand the fact that there is a black bar at the bottom of my screen. Honestly whoever thought “hey let’s put a black bar right where the camera should be and put unnecessary icons for every tab there” is the single most stupid person on this earth. Not to mention how UGLY it looks. I feel like I’m working with a beta version of this app and I’m sure the actual beta was better than this.

Tips: DONT MAKE UNNECESSARY CHANGES TO THE APP. If I were snap, I’d go back to when we had the blue on top of the messages and the purple on top of the stories because it just looked way better.

405,2,"Snapchat Discover is LOADED with unskippable ads. We used to be able to skip thru them but now, you are stopped about every 2 snaps for a 5 second ad that you cannot skip. As of late there have been a few issues where Snapchat will not tell you that you’ve already watched an entire story in discover. I end up thinking I didn’t finish it so I start it up and it goes back to the beginning. This prompts me to click thru the story to get to where I thought I left off at. The 5 second unskippable ads pop up again and I realize I’ve finished the story already and it still shows up as a fresh story. I’m convinced Snapchat is intentionally placing “glitches” like this in the app to boost advertising exposure. I watch the same story 2, even 3 times and all of it is loaded with ads. It’s awful.

774,5,One update that would be really convenient is sending a notification when someone is about to lose a streak because some people aren’t on their phones a lot. Another feature that should be added is being able to change your add name because a lot of people put ridiculous names when they were young. A bug that needs to be fixed is snaps not showing up I know it’s a big issue with me. Also my snap keeps “waiting to send” to certain people but will send my other snaps and it’s very frustrating when in a conversation or need to talk to someone right away and don’t have their phone number.,9/4/20 7:14,0.042166666666666665,0.5007142857142857,positive
775,5,"I love sharing various nonchalant and nondescript moments to my friends, and Snapchat makes that incredibly easy and intuitive with its user interface.

That being said, the app sometimes glitches out. For example, a notification doesn’t go away, and I traces it back to a friend’s New Snap that doesn’t go away after opening. The red square is displaying as empty with a red outline, and the words New Snap remains even though I’ve already opened the Snap.

Small minute bugs like this really make the app annoying to use, especially when it affects my notifications. Other than that, five stars.",9/2/20 16:38,0.009361471861471864,0.4441017316017316,positive
781,5,I love this app and use it everyday. Though I’ve heard problems with glitching from the views I haven’t experienced any myself.  If you don’t have this app I recommend you to get it it has funny filters to play around with and it’s a great way to stay in touch with friends. It’s safe there’s no way a stranger can contact you unless they send you a friend request and you add them back and you don’t have to keep your location on. The only down thing about this app is it doesn’t save your messages. Besides that I really recommend you get it. Stay in touch with your friends post on your story play around with fun filters and watch short clips👍👍👍,9/26/19 1:44,0.24953703703703708,0.5282407407407407,positive
788,5,I just got the most random update today. It made my snap all wonky. I could usually slide on a persons name to open their chats and now when I slide over it opens the map. I don’t like this. It was just easier to swipe up to get to the map that way it was easier to get too and you could just swipe to get a chat and to get to map. It’s also weird how it has the little chat pic neat to unopened snaps and whenever i try to open a snap if i don’t click to far in it opens the chat and not the snap. Which is really unfortunate when i just wanna is my right hand and my left is preoccupied. Or I don’t feel like reaching to tap it.,9/19/20 5:31,-0.11264880952380951,0.5488095238095237,trust

They are really pushing their snap maps and their stories side. Which I can understand they are trying to branch out. Yet the implementation seems cheap, heavy, bloated, and outdated. The looks aren’t the only thing, now the app runs laggy. I can see hesitation with my scrolls and swipes when switching from different pages. It really makes me feel like I’m using a 2010 phone and software.

However, after I receive maybe more than 5 minutes of snaps from someone else, the app just canNOT fathom how to load all of the information.

They’ve recently made some changes that haven’t improved it IMO. To start with—the ugly black line around the ghost. It’s jarring to look at and makes the logo look unbalanced.

Secondly (and this is the greater issue) but when I resize my text, it automatically re-formats it. Stop that. I know what format I want the text in. I know what size I want it to be. If my friends have to break out a microscope in order to read my captions, that’s a deliberate choice on my part. The reformatting is incredibly annoying and not to be pretentious but it’s ruining my artistic vision.

Other than that, the app is fun. It seems that not everyone has the same filters available to them at all times and it’s unclear how to get them for yourself (they’ve recently added a “More filters” option which is nice, but I wish I could pick and choose which ones show up automatically myself—for example, removing ones I don’t use) but I enjoy it anyway.

I then tried changing it through my email and it said that the password had successfully updated, but when I tried to log in using the new password it said it was incorrect.

1209,2,"I’ve had snapchat for about 2 years now. I’ve loved it because it let me communicate not only with my close friends, but also friends of mine who lived in other countries. 

However, I just recently updated it to the new version and now it’s become very troublesome. It won’t let me into my account saying it’s been ‘temporarily locked’ when I have never used any third-party apps and I have always followed their Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. I waited for two days and it would still not let me back into my account. I wrote Snapchat support multiple emails and got the same response for each one (none of which helped me at all). 

So, I created a new account and it worked fine. But then I logged out to see if I could get into my old account-still could not- so I tried to get back into my new account. AND I HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY LOCKED OUT AGAIN!!!! 

I contacted Snapchat Support once again, and still got the same email as before. So if you are currently debating whether or not to get it right now. I wouldn’t. I would wait until the next update comes out, so you don’t have to deal with this BS like I currently am.",9/8/20 4:50,0.11489617153679654,0.33549213943950784,trust

It’s ridiculous that if your account is compromised you can’t get support from Snapchat to stop someone from posting all your pictures and sending messages to your friends. Other apps/companies do way better and have more concern for your safety. I’m very disappointed in Snapchat and am very upset that someone is pretending to be me and that I cannot get a hold of someone from Snapchat to help stop that person.

1504,5,I like the format of the new Snapchat update but I hate how you can’t swipe right of the chats and if you do it takes you to the maps which is kind of annoying because it was so much easier the way it was I really wish y’all could please change it back to wear you can just swipe right without haven’t to just click on the chat because sometimes you don’t really want to open it at the moment and sliding it just a little to the right you can kind of see what someone sent without opening it.,9/22/20 3:01,0.07185760667903525,0.5186920222634509,trust

I’m just really upset because Snapchat is like one of the ways that me and all my friends communicate and Snapchat not work and my friends thinking that I left them on open for almost a whole day.

But the new update I have to say the least is very confusing and inconvenient. Having to swipe all the time is very tedious and frustrating. If someone texts me and I have some non open snaps they have sent me I have to look though all of them to get to the text. The older version was much more simple and easy to use. Having to swipe for the maps instead of swiping down where you would take a picture is very inconvenient as well.

- dark mode 
- a way to see how many friends you have 
- have someone you just added appear on your recent snaps list. Right now it only shows it there when they add you back but why just have it there  to begin with? Or maybe make a section for “recently added friends” 
- please add a way to sort snaps by. Right now the default is by time. You can add a way to sort by best friends, opened, delivered, and new snaps. It’ll make it so much more organized. 
- add a personal status option like discord 
- why can’t you multi-snap when you’re replying to someone by double tapping? You can only do a default snap 
- why can’t you make multi-snap have an infinite snap time like a regular snap? It can only be 1-10 sec",9/2/20 23:27,0.14489538239538238,0.4801712176712177,positive

Another thing I don’t like is how often I see the message “(person) is typing...” because they don’t send an actual message until you see the “from (person)” message.

1919,3,first of all snapchat is one of the most boring apps aside from Instagram and it’s needs so many new updates that will improve it. It’s needs to send you a notification if someone blocks or removes you as a friend. It shouldn’t say how someone added you. we should be allowed to unsave texts that the other person saved. more realistic and fun features. a count of how many people have added you or you added. streaks shouldn’t be a thing anymore. pin more than just three conversations. there’s so many more updates and new features this app needs but that’s all I can think off for now.,9/19/20 4:42,0.2403138528138528,0.4750541125541125,positive

My issue with snapchat is watching the stories on the “For you” page and my subscriptions. when it’s in an ad and you slide left to go to the next story and then come back the ad will not play. Most of the time the timing bar at the top freezes and the screen shows no picture of the ad and it will be stuck not allowing to pass the ad. another thing is when viewing subscription stories and i exit the story it no longer bookmarks my position where i left it. now it starts it from the beginning.

1944,1,"I decided to get Snap Chat because my friends recommended it to me. Never have I hated any app like this in the way that I do.

Snap Map:
I absolutely hate the “snap map”. The concept of it is unsettling, especially with all the stories I’ve heard of stalkers using it to find where people live. It’s not something that should be in an app like this, especially with all the issues I’ve seen.

Advertising:
Good god, I can’t go one minute without having an ad show up in my face on this app. There everywhere and it’s ridiculously obnoxious at times, especially since most of them are political ads. Seriously, nobody wants to deal with political ads, especially when it’s basically every other ad.

Random snaps:
I don’t know how many random snap pictures I’ve gotten from people I have never known. Seriously, this is ridiculous. It’s one thing if it happens once, but having dozens of random people sending me snaps expecting me to know them is beyond infuriating.

Conclusion:
Don’t get this app! This has so many issues and problems that it’s not worth getting or setting up an account for.",9/17/19 15:45,-0.1408787878787879,0.6123333333333333,trust

So now I have to grab the bitmoji and slide slowly to see the text if I don’t want to open it completely. This is a definite downgrade for the app and makes me want to stop using Snapchat. Also when I swipe to go to another page I think it’s to fast now and it often times skips a page so I’m either on the snap map or the Snapchat shows. I liked having only 3 major pages to swipe between but the update is terrible.

While this may be only an opinion, I think it would benefit everyone if you added a toggle option for the navigation bar. A second thing was a new area for snap maps. In my opinion it would be better to have kept the old version since the camera is first thing people see when opening Snapchat. It is also more convenient that way since we wouldn’t have to swipe through as much tabs to get to it.

2868,1,I’ve had my new account since December of 2017 and Snapchat was amazing until today. The app auto updated and the new update is horrible. I do not like how you have to tap to open chats instead of just swiping. Swiping was so much easier and out of habit i do it and the snap maps screen pops up. I also hate how snap maps is to the left of everything and you have to swipe to access it instead of pinching on the camera screen. It’s super laggy and the picture has a gray type film after every picture as well as bad quality. Please go back to the update before this one. It’s terrible.

The issue I have is the new way to view the maps. I am so used to swiping over on a conversation to open it, and when you all of a sudden change everything I know, you effectively ruin the app. 
Now when you swipe over, you open up maps. Then you’ll go back, and you’ll do it again on accident, because obviously that’s what you’ve been doing the last 3+ years. 

To add to this issue, perhaps you just viewed a snapchat picture/ video, and you swipe over the conversation to go back to replay. Oops! Too bad you forgot that swiping pulls up the map, instead of opening the conversation, and now you can’t replay the snaps.

I also have a problem where when I watch stories they don’t go away as if I just never watched them. I really want this to be fixed,9/4/20 7:16,-0.024801587301587297,0.4620039682539683,fear

Moving where to access snap maps was not the move at all. It’s very inconvenient and annoying when you to go type and u end up on snap maps. Also having the bottom black with all the options is annoying because again it makes the screen smaller and not just on my phone!!

I think it’s quite useful and it’s very fun to use, however lately I’ve been experiencing some problems with loading times.

Recently I found that deleting some of the things that take up storage on my phone help with the performance however this time that has not worked. I do think that this is some thing Snapchat needs to look into as a problem since it is one of the main communication apps.

1,3,"I’m sorry to say it, but something is definitely wrong with Snapchat. In all my years of using the app, I have never been this disappointed. Although Snapchat is my main social app on my phone, it has been really bugging me. For example, it has been taking up to 5 minutes to send a chat everytime I try to send something. Before I am told my phone is slow, let me reassure you this is not only a problem for me but for my peers as well. Also, I have been receiving Snapchat’s from WEEKS ago, leaving the other person to conclude I have been ignoring them. When it is taking 4 weeks for a singular snap to come through, there is an obvious problem with the app. Likewise, my peers and I have noticed that when somebody responds to me, it’s very slow and won’t load or I don’t get it at all. Just the other day I received a snap, and when I asked about it I learned it had said I left them on opened whereas for me it said I had been left on delivered. The amount of time I have wasted trying to solve this problem along with the taking 5 minutes to send one thing problem, I could have been doing other things, so I have been veering off the app. Unfortunately, I do not think this app will be worth it, especially if it keeps traveling downhill at this rate.

The cursor won’t stay between letters, and just seems to go to the beginning or end of the name, which is a huge inconvenience, especially if I’m just adding a letter or emoji to the beginning of they’re name to indicate that I have a streak with them, or if I’m just trying to delete that emoji/and or letter.

This problem has been present since January of this year. Second thing: Snapchat is like the ONLY social platform that doesn’t have a dark mode yet. PLEASE MAKE A DARK MODE bc even with my brightness turned down and night shift on, it still hurts my eyes in the dark. A dark mode would be really cool too. Please fix these, and thank you.

144,4,"So today I went into Snapchat and I wanted to take a picture of my cat and when I looked in the corner there wasn’t the button to switch  the camera around!! And I know you can double tap to turn the camera around but that’s not all because when I went to turn the flash on it wasn’t there either!!! Sooo I restarted my phone and I thought it might work but oh boy was I wrong!!! And when I went to go to my messages instead of the button to go to the messages you have to swipe and same with my friends stories!! Sooo I know that is not that big of a deal right but the worse part is when I click on my bitmoji in the upper left hand corner it won’t take me there!! So I can’t even ask Snapchat for help, view my story, or clear my cache!! This is so stupid and I am literally crying over it because it is the app I use most!! Pleas help me!!

145,3,This app was cool but then it turned to whatever when i noticed that some bad things were happing. Like when i try to record there are times where it freezes and i would have to close the app and especially when i have flash on. There’s times where the app closes by its self for no reason. When i’m about to text someone it closes a few times and i end up being able to see what they said. ALL OF MY MEMORIES DISAPPEARED from this month up to 4th of July!!! It was fine one night and literally the next morning they were gone and i didn’t even log out of snapchat or logged in from another device. I deleted a whole bunch of things from my phone to try and get them back but they never came back. If it was because i didn’t back them up then it wasn’t completely my fault that it takes forever to back them up with both my wifi and my cellular data. I find this dumb because it should back up automatically with no problems without me having to do it. I’m still hoping that there’s a way to get them back.,10/31/20 16:17,0.048014322916666685,0.3026041666666667,positive
151,1,"Every update, I and many people I know are being pushed away from using Snapchat. The app has distanced itself from its community and doesn’t listen to criticism. It constantly pushes out updates that not only implement complicated and useless features but it gets rid of the features that made using Snapchat in the past fun, not to mention how disgusting the UI has become, first with stories scrolling going horizontally and the addition of all these promoted or featured stories. Then stories were also put on the chat page. Managing or removing friends has become more difficult as well as seeing who hasn’t added you back. The camera is becoming to cluttered but there are too many features to condense it without adding 10x as many steps to get to a certain feature. I’m also shocked that in nearly 10 years of being released they haven’t added the ability to remove multiple people at once, this feels like such a simple and important feature. Hopefully Snapchat starts listening to its users rather than going full corporate and implementing features that cause its users to leave the app on a daily basis.",10/21/20 23:39,0.024571428571428574,0.49380952380952386,positive

Every time I would send a snap or a chat to groups or individuals, the snap or chat message that was sent would be in a forever loading loop. I would try to close the app to see if that would fix the problem but I’d come to the app, click “retry sending” and whatever I was trying to send gets erased as if nothing was sent to the person in the first place. Another issue I’ve been noticing is that sometimes the app freaks out to the point that you’ll still see unread snaps or chat message notifications in the app even though you may have already seen the snap or read the chat message. I’ve check my cellar data and my WiFi connection every time to see if those two factors seem to be the issue causing these app freak outs and I don’t think they seem to be case.",10/14/19 15:53,0.1875,0.5125,negative

Very very disappointed in Snapchat, the worst customer service, can’t even call nor email, there is only automatic system that you have to pick out the points you have trouble with and that’s it ...

Another thing is that whenever i am looking at someone’s story or subscription or for you then i will tap on the phone to see the next part of the story and it will say “sorry your connection is down” or something like that and i will see if I have any Internet connection and i will have internet connection and all bars and i will refresh the app and the same thing will happen.,10/2/20 0:16,0.08418803418803418,0.5222222222222223,anticipation

UPDATE:: 
yet again, snapchat updated. there’s now a button that shows up when someone sends a picture that’ll take you to the map. just revert back to the swipe technique. i’d rather have the map back to normal, and my zoomed pictures are gone and i’m finally over that, but i wish there wasn’t that stupid bar at the bottom. i get used to one thing, and it changes. i tap to open and reply to pictures in the same place- the very right side with my right thumb- but now i can’t because there’s the button for the chat. stop messing with my flow 😐",10/7/20 2:32,-0.029503968253968255,0.5518849206349207,positive

However, in recent years the app has just turned into one ad after the next. I understand that apps need money to function and continue existing but now it’s liked every time I open the app I regret it. The stories they have are often times gossipy trash and even if they have one that looks interesting I immediately lose interest when opening it to be bombarded with ads. The stories are long and drawn out (probably to expose the viewer to more ads) and often times won’t stay the end because the websites are buggy trash. I’m really disappointed in the way Snapchat has been handled recently and I’m very close to just deleting the whole thing off my phone (if it wasn’t for the memories gesture I probably would).

I get they were trying something new and I’m fine with it but my only request is for them to find a way to implement the slide to open chats.

These ads were so terrible that I HAD to share them with my friends. But snapchats latest update now bans this activity. I’m sure ad impressions will drop dramatically because of this.

It is so biased towards democratic/liberal ideas, if we really want our youth to be educated there should be equal information posted here about both political parties. Im not arguing one side is better than the other, but the app really shoves the democratic thinking right in your face and in turn I feel causes a lot of hate towards Trump and many social issues today. Which is not good considering he in fact is our president. Why can’t Snapchat be more informative and less biased?",10/6/20 13:37,0.06544913419913419,0.3860930735930736,positive

It makes enjoying the app very frustrating when I’m texting friends or sending streaks. When I’m in the middle of doing something it closes out. I normally enjoy the app, but this has become a big deal. Also, I am having an issue with my views. I have two accounts so whenever I log out of my main account and log back in, the number of views I had decreases to 200 exact. For example, this one day I reached 1.4k views but when I had to log out for my other account and logged back in, my views dropped to 200. Please, if possible, fix this issue.

Another problem is that if I try and click the n my chat or discover buttons, it won’t take me there. I have to slide my finger across my screen instead of just clicking on it.

878,2,I find myself using this app often and for the texting part is pretty good. However when you are trying to go through someone’s story or are on a discover page the ads are overwhelming. I can’t watch 2 pages before an ad pops up and interrupts my page. The ads are irrelevant and repeating causing them to be annoying. I would suggest reducing the amount of ads and also changing them up a little so they don’t repeat so much. Another problem is the battery usage. I feel when I am on the app it uses all my battery. I would suggest you reduce the amount of battery usage the app uses so the user can spend time on other apps or be on the app longer. If you take these suggestions into consideration I feel you will gain popularity and users. Thank you for reading my review.,10/27/19 15:54,0.00468749999999999,0.696875,positive

Please do this ASAP on the upcoming update!!!!
Thank you. P.s please add a dark mode, also an idea & if ya'll can Snapchat should really have a better more interesting design for exsample: let us have a customized theme for our whole snap profile, something similar to Instagram but much better since instagram is lacking to add it's own customized background make us be able to show our personality in our own profile.

A second issue is not only that, but i cannot swipe down into my menu bar, where my streak score and story is held. This prevents me from adding to my story and irritates me a bit.

My account has been hacked and a user has changed my password and email, and set up 2FA.

I’ve been sending support messages about this for over a week but no one has gotten back to me.  I keep getting redirected to their help page where it instructs me to “change my password if [I] think [I’ve] been compromised” but that’s literally impossible because my email was changed.

Another suggestion is the usernames, we’ve all been there when we made the worst usernames but at the time we thought were so cool.

Shortcuts: Every time I try to use shortcuts to make my streaks faster, one of my shortcuts deletes as I add a new one.

When I go to save a photo it’s right beside the story button and I always accidentally click it. I accidentally posted a photo on my story and it was on there for an hour and I never noticed it and I was so embarrassed afterwards. A lot of other people have told me that they have done the same mistake too so it’s not just me.

1350,2,"i have never written a review before this new snapchat update. this is how much i despise it. why would you take a decently made app and turn it into the horrible piece of garbage it is now. the new update is satan as an app. the new layout and the chunky bar at the bottom of the screen makes it look like the app was just released. it makes it look clunky and messy. it fills me with rage when you try to swipe into your messages and it sends you to the map. why would you turn a popular app into this new horrible version of its prime. the new layout and navigation of the app will force users to basically re learn how to use the app. i would suggest that you have a company wide drug test, because it seems like whoever made this new update is on copious amounts of drugs. i have not met a single person who likes this new update. the only reason i’ve given this two stars instead of one is because my friends still prefer to communicate on it. unfortunately. i won’t delete the app but i will feel a seething anger bubble in my mind every time i open this dog crap equivalent of an app.

I think Snapchat would be doing everyone a favor if they switched it back to Snapchat before this update.

Streaks are like one of the things I do to make myself have a goal and priority. It kind of just helps me give myself a responsibility to feel accomplished. I take my streaks more serious than my schoolwork. Just know, this would be five stars but let me explain why I gave 4. Personally, I love bitmojis because they’re fun to just mess around with the outfits and stuff. But, one thing I’m kind of upset about is the fact that guys get hawaiian shirts and girls don’t. Call me petty, I don’t care. But when I say I am known for hawaiian shirts, I mean it. I mean, hawaiian shirts are basically a personality trait of mine and I’ve been begging you guys for about a year to add hawaiian shirts for girls. I think that would make my life complete and give me the five star experience I know you want me to have.

Complete loss of trust in the owners and development team.  They work with law enforcement now to filter through your messages and report illegal activity.  Sad to see a company go down this route and to see a company hurt its clientele.  I’ll be switching to any of other of the various messaging and social media apps out there that actually do prioritize privacy!

So bye bye also to your intrusive, horrible advertising strategy of forcing ad clicks and forcing users to visit advertiser sites.  ✌🏽to your desperate attempt at increasing advertising revenue with aesthetically disgusting app updates and interface.",10/6/19 14:21,-0.3789351851851852,0.5942129629629629,negative

I’m partial about the way my home screen looks, and the new icon just messes with the whole aesthetic of iOS. It’s inconsistent. At least there should be an option to change it like some other apps have. That’s my main gripe. Also with the release of iOS 13, I think a dark mode should be implemented into snap.

I make a mental note to NEVER patronize the products doing that - a personal boycott.  

For the ads that let you click away fast, I tend to give them a more favorable view. I then click away quick when they repeatedly appear in the feed, and I appreciate being able to do that!

Then there are times where the non-click-away ads come so quickly, you can’t enjoy the feed - so I unsubscribe. 

It’s getting to the point that Snapchat is training me to leave the app a lot more quickly than I used to leave. So I guess that is a good thing for my screen time!",10/11/20 0:24,0.22647058823529412,0.49264705882352944,trust

To start off, we would make a button to open all snaps at once and to send streaks all at the same time with people you have streaks with. Secondly people of snap want to be able to change their boring usernames. To include we also want to be able to pick our best friends for our best friends list and not have random people on it. Continuing we would like the snap logo to be blue on certain dates and make the ghost into a goat cause snap is lit and amazing. Lastly we would like a dark mode because on Apple iPhones there is a dark mode that most people choose this mode because it’s something different.

115,1,"I have used snap since 2013 and never had any major issues with it. Tonight they randomly terminated my account, meaning I also am banned from making another. They deleted all of my memories: baby pictures, my dog that’s no longer alive, pictures of my cat as a kitten, concerts, and friends and family. Memories I will never get to relive are just gone in a blink of an eye. I’m guessing I broke a guideline somehow or they terminated me just because an ex reported me for posting pictures with my now boyfriend. They gave me zero warning or clarification of what I even did wrong, they didn’t explain in the email. I’ve struggled to try and find an email or phone number and found nothing to actually contact them. I reached out on Twitter and they just told me they couldn’t help through Twitter and to look at their terms and services. The worst support from an app ever and they are the least understanding service if they seriously just terminate accounts that have been open for 7 years with no warning or way of getting memories.

127,4,"I’ve updated the app to its latest version and comparing it to when I first had it, I dunno. Snapchat, you have to realize that it’s okay to leave things as they are in their glory. The fact that some of my longer videos are split into parts of 10 seconds and there doesn’t seem to be a way to change that is really irritating. Why should I have to swipe after ten seconds of watching the same video? I’ve recognized these videos from stories I’d set to auto-save. Flooding our memories with those videos instead of keeping them within the ‘Stories’ category is redundant and inconvenient. Not much point in updating the app for format changes as simple as bold lettering and a bolder logo either.  I’m also not sure about everyone else, I may be in the minority here, but I actually liked it when our memories were in different sizes. It looked goofy, different. I feel like that was a solid ‘snapchat thing’. Now it’s kinda just like looking at my camera roll. Just my two cents.",11/3/19 12:35,0.06666666666666667,0.5335901027077498,negative

I’m used to sliding and enjoyed seeing someone’s messages before I had to open it. Now all I get when I slide is the map which I don’t care to see at all. Secondly, now when I take a picture it does this edit + send thing pops up in the bottom? The hell is that? Lastly, there are a god forsaken amount of ads on here. I get it, you want more money and people are willing to pay for ads. But make them skippable at least. I hate having to wait 5-6 seconds after every story I watch. The hell is wrong with you guys? Stop updating. You want to make us happy? Then let us be able to skip ads, slide to see messages, and pinch the screen to see maps.

It’s just super annoying having to deal with that awkward situation so many times.

I find myself retaking photos five or six times thinking it’s me, when in fact it is not. Seems like there is a software glitch when communicating to the iPhone’s camera.

434,3,"I’ve always enjoyed Snapchat, it’s great for communicating. However, I’ve always found the experience annoying once upgrading to an iPhone X. Due to the camera taking up the entire screen, the frame is very zoomed and details are often lost compared to the Camera app. Another grievance I have is the inability to take screenshots without rounded edges, regardless of if the image is actually wrapping to the screen’s edge. Rounded edges are always annoying to have on a photo, and it’d be wonderful to be able to just have the original 90° edges that were present in previous iPhones.

My solution to this would be to implement black bars along the top and bottom of the app. This would allow for images to not be rounded, and the camera to not be hyper zoomed. If not making this mandatory, a black bar option would be greatly appreciated for those who dislike rounded edges.",11/19/19 20:10,0.10882352941176468,0.509313725490196,negative

When I go to open snap chat it will be a black screen with a white bar on the top and the app will not work. So I have to delete the app and re-download the app and that means I have to type in my information and except all the things that ask me like to access the camera and stuff all over again. Sometimes it even happens multiple times a day. In fact it happened just a second ago as it is downloading I’m typing this review. I was reading some other reviews and there is many other people having problems. I would love if somebody could fix Snapchat and I will go back to the way it was.,11/16/20 14:47,0.1217948717948718,0.30641025641025643,positive
532,5,"Overall, snapchat is a fine app. It’s a good way to keep in contact with friends and save memories. But the problem is that snapchat has terrible costumer service. I have been trying all day to get into contact with someone about my account. Someone I don’t know changed my password and signed me out, and now I can’t get back in. The email associated with the account apparently isn’t valid, and my phone number is for an old, destroyed phone. Most apps would ask security questions, or have you give an emergency contact in case something like this happens. 

I’m not asking for much, I just need the photos of my dog that recently died back. Please, if someone at the company is reading this, show some empathy. I am begging you.",11/30/19 3:34,0.08787878787878789,0.3272727272727273,positive

I went to where you did that, and it said “you need to aces the camera” and then it had a purple button that said “settings” so I pressed settings so I could fix it, but whenever I got on settings there was no way for me to “turn on the camera” I deleted the app after a couple of tries and I redownloaded it.

610,3,"Well, been a loyal user of this app since 2013. I hate to say that I’ve watched a company that seemingly cared about user experience turn into money hungry scum. Why are there ads every 3 slides now? Then also ads have their own story as well. Then it’s mandatory to watch all of the adds. Not only that, they are put in the worst spot because like I said, you guys just stick them every 3 slides to where viewers can’t even watch a story in peace but in pieces. 

Also there are glitches within stories when you try to rewind, it will either do 1 of 2 things. 1.) it rewinds to the first slide of the story(ads and all) or 2.) it closes the story and disappears into limbo.
Not the only glitches going on with the story either. A lot of creators try to edit around with the slide would change and now they don’t even allign half the time.

Lastly, I wish there was a way for users to know their voice is heard. Snapchat used to take the opinions into consideration and actually tried to incorporate ideas, now you’re too busy stuffing your pockets with ad money to give af. Spotlights is useless to a user like me and the new black bar design at the bottom of the screen is cluttering the space of what used to be a clean and simple, user friendly design.",11/29/20 22:23,-0.0428872053872054,0.5413900913900913,anticipation

724,1,DO NOT RECOMMEND APP! Let me just start by saying I’ve been using Snapchat since 2013. The pure beauty of Snapchat used to be how simple and easy it was to see what people were doing. Now they’ve added all kinds of trash that no one cares about like special short tv show stories and maps and all this extra stuff that just ruined the clean look of the app. They took something great and completely filled it to the brim with anything they could find. I mean be honest do you use Snapchat to watch tv shows? or do you use it to see what famous people are up to and what your friends are doing? It used to be so easy and simple the plain was the main reason I even kept the app but since they’re trying to be like every other app instead of being just Snapchat it’s not even worth the time of day navigating through all of the unnecessary crap they’ve added.,11/19/20 4:08,0.13598214285714288,0.5827678571428574,positive

I hope they bring back the Version 10 set up with the next update I found it actually had an easier interface to understand and it stayed more true to the original also they are pushing maps to much I love the maps it’s a cool feature but it shouldn’t be THE feature they push.

970,3,"Okay so let me start off Snapchat is awesome, great app for teens to use (lol). The only problems are the bugs it has
1. Its slow: it started happening last week on November 7, when I’m texting someone and I send the message it takes a couple seconds to send (not like it used to before) then if i want to save it, it takes seconds to react after I touch the screen. So it’s been acting up a bit there.
2. The stories i sub to keep popping back up after i have seen them. Everytime I open Snap, it shows that I haven’t seen them at all yet. So it gets annoying and i feel like I have to constantly open them and close them. 
3. When will the Zodiac Signs be changed?: so I heard that there are 13 zodiac signs now, meaning that me and other people are no longer the signs we used to be. So I was wondering if you could update them so we know and see what we are now seeing it as a fun thing to check 🙂

I know many people have said the same for the first two problems, but I’m bringing them up again just to help this reach the Snapchat team, i hope you guys have the heart to fix this bug!

1365,1,I enjoy using Snapchat when it works but I’ve had many problems with streaks disappearing in the past and Snapchat doesn’t do anything about it. Recently I logged out of my account and when I tried to log back in it said I had the wrong password. I tried to reset my password using my phone number and email that are verified on my account but it said neither of them were correct. I guess somehow my phone number and email were removed from my account when I logged out because I have no way to log in. I am very frustrated and have been trying nonstop for the past 2 days to log into my account and I’ve messaged Snapchat multiple times but they take a very long time to respond and aren’t helpful whatsoever.,11/27/19 17:54,-0.10749999999999997,0.343,trust

There’s one problem I have with it though. I kinda wish that after you unadd someone that you could re-add them again. I have a couple friends that I got into an argument with and they unadded me and now they can’t re-add me now that we’ve figured it out and everything.

2221,3,I think the app is great and very useful. I’ve just noticed that a lot of my chats start opening by themselves. I was wondering if that can change so that Snapchat doesn’t open my chats . I don’t know why it does that but I hope it can stop because it bothers me knowing that’s their opening my chats. I feel as if there invaded my privacy. I don’t like knowing that there opening or going thru my chats. It really bothers me . Hopefully this can be fixed and my chats stop opening by themselves. And yes I updated my Snapchat and no one eles had my password or had logged into my account .,11/12/20 21:07,0.298,0.32999999999999996,trust

1. Emojis 

I, personally, do not like emojis. I dislike them so much, in fact, that I removed the keyboard from my phone. In Snapchat, you have no choice but to have “friend emojis”. Personally, I hate having an emoji next to someone’s name. I wish you guys would make it optional! 

2. Discover

I don’t like all of the discover channels. I wish I didn’t have all that spam all over the page. I’d like to just use Snapchat as a messaging app, you know? I’d appreciate a feature to turn those off.

It also always without a fail crashes if I put my camera in selfie mode while using snapchat.
I barely use it anymore, just to answer people after the snaps pile up in my inbox.

Edit2: The phone and snapchat have been updated a few times since the original problem but it has only continued to get worse. I haven’t used the app for a months but decided to try to open it. It immediately crashed, I deleted and redownloaded, instacrash, tried again, instacrash.

If you ever have a problem snap is just going to redirect you to going on the app to solve it. Why is everything in app? Example: you get an email saying your account info has been changed.

If you don’t have your two factor verification set up (which should be mandatory) if you lose access to your account you’re screwed. 

Support is TERRIBLE, they will stop contacting you mid conversation. It’s sad because snap prides themselves in privacy but have it to where anyone could hack your account. There’s 100s of reviews complaining about it.

There is so much blasphemy, so much sexual content, so much completely false and blatantly leftist and liberal news, so much absolute bull crap in this app. The developers should be ashamed by the amount, and kinds of ads/media they allow on their discover page. If there was a setting to turn it off I would love that and my rating would go much higher. 

If you are gullible in the slightest, do not download this app. The things you will see are pure evil. I cannot believe children are allowed by so many to use this moronic app.

Its ridiculous i sat here for 30 -40 min on the website trying to figure out how to fill out a request to submit a complaint and i still cant find and ontop of that i cant call you guys to figure out whats the issue

Now to talk about the actual issue
I have been locked out of my account twice now(iv read the rules bu the way) and according to the rules i havnt done anything wrong? Once in a while ill add like 5-10 people bak or on quick add? Or post a whole bunch of videos on my storys but thats fine ? But this time i was permanently locked in the middle of writing a post. I went to see the issue of why i was permanently blocked but when i clicked to unlocked it said to click “here” so i did. When i clicked it everything crashed. I did this at least 10 times and everytime it crashed either telling me my browser was acting up or my internet wasnt secure. So i went on my phone to do it another 5 times and still didnt work. Yall need to fix this along with getting a real customer service area going on.. this is a waste of time going to the website when u cant get REAL help lemme also say iv been using Snapchat for probably 6-8 years and iv only had this problem this month.

67,2,I’m about ready to delete and stop using snapchat because it has gotten so bad it’s to a point where you can’t even search for people you already have added. Plus it’s too much promoted content. I would pay for a version that didn’t have all the extra promoted stuff nobody downloads snapchat for that. They download it to communicate with their friends and watch what their friends post and talk to them. Snapchat has been on a big decline and just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse it did. Goodbye snapchat! Maybe I’ll come back when you get your act together but right now the app is more frustrating than it is enjoyable so I don’t think I’ll be using it for a while and I’m sure everyone else feels this way because everyone I know sure does. Used to be a 5 star app but now it doesn’t deserve more than 1 or 2 starts at most. I’m very disappointed. If I could choose what version to go back to I would choose to go back to when it was just messaging and snaps with an entire page dedicated to story’s organized alphabetically whit new ones at the top. And it was cool to be able to see who someone else’s best friend was. #makesnapchatgreatagain,12/14/20 21:53,0.14987824675324676,0.4837376743626744,positive

It’s also cool having the “snap map” to see locations of friends that have it turned on.

121,5,"OMG, like this app is amazing!! I use Snapchat almost every day and I send tons of snaps with my friends! We text and snap back and forth. I’ve had this app for maybe 3 years or so.... anyways, but I absolutely enjoy it! I love talking to my friends especially during the pandemic and I love snapping too. I love the awesome features. In my opinion, I hope more features will come soon in the future. The only thing is when you’re snapping and after if you want to write a caption, you don’t get that many characters. In my opinion, I don’t meant to hurt anybody’s feelings but it’s a little irritating. Snapchat is all about having fun, connecting with your friends and expressing who you are. I can say confidently that me and all of my friends even my cousins spend just about all our time on Snapchat. It has brought many people I know together in ways I’ve never seen by another app. So far, Snapchat is one of my favorite and recently used apps. I think that it’s really cool to share photos with your friends, so you can show them what an awesome time you were having or if the photo is a special moment between the two of you!;) I also love that you can play many different games and use many different Bitmojis. The only thing that worries me is, when you make your Bitmoji what if hackers find out your identity? Maybe, I’m overreacting but it could still happen. 

Please don’t forget to read and have a great day;)💜❤️❤️💜

137,5,"I have a suggestion for the Snapchat messages. (This is for people who save chats) In our messages we should be able to access old messages faster, Instead of having to take forever to swipe up to find them. We should be able to press the persons bitmoji and select any saved chat image, selecting the image will load the image up of course but also load the messages that were sent during that specific day/time. I know it may seem like a “little much” but if you think about it, it’s actually pretty convenient because you don’t have to waste time swiping ALL the way up. All you have to do is click on a saved image and the messages will automatically load up to that day as soon as you close the image. iPhone also had this at one point and took it away I believe but pleaseee Take This into consideration it’ll make this much more easier to access.

150,3,I could be using snapchat for months no problem...then a new update comes out which is totally useless. nothing has changed except for the look & it looks ugly. this big black border at the bottom is distracting and the swipe into chat feature is gone. i don’t like the idea of tapping to enter a chat. i don’t really know who comes up with the ideas for the updates but i guarantee they don’t use snapchat because wow! i’m giving it three stars because i don’t like the update but i don’t believe i can stop using snapchat. i like the app it’s just usually the updates are...useless. ALSO there is a new update and you can’t HOLD someone’s snap story anymore. so say they had a text all the way at the top...there’s no way you’re gonna see what it says because you can’t hold onto the snap anymore. and it also gets rid of the sound.

But never an ongoing problem. I’ve always liked the simplicity of the app and is not overwhelming like Instagram or Facebook. However, I do have an irk when it comes to the videos. One of Snapchat’s best updates, in my opinion, allows us to record videos more than 15 seconds long. When it comes down to editing the video, it divides into 15 second sections. This means if I want to remove sound from the entire video, I have to individually remove it from every clip. By logic, if someone wants text placed or no sound, it should update for the entire video clip, not just the selected portion. Copying and pasting captions into every portion is so redundant. Overall, a very meticulous process that wastes tremendous amount of time; it should definitely be changed in the following update.",12/9/19 5:37,0.04837962962962963,0.4231481481481482,negative

198,2,"The update came with adding a black bar with the menu to the bottom of the screen. It looks ugly and is distracting. Worst of all, it obstructs the bottom portion of the camera so that you can’t see the full image you’re trying to photograph. Snapchat has such a simple interface to navigate, it doesn’t need a menu bar at the bottom. It’s visually distracting, and the black looks bad with the primarily white interface. 
I wish the map was back in its usual place instead of to the left of the contacts. Now, I can’t swipe a contact to send a message, I have to tap. People barely even use the map, it’s not something that needs to be so easily accessible in the main horizontal flow of pages.
If you could only change one thing, you should change back the camera page to how it was before without the black menu bar at the bottom. It’s annoying not being able to see the camera in entirety!

It was once my favorite app but I’ve come to realize they don’t care about the people who use their app. My account was hacked and when I reached out to Snapchat for assistance they didn’t even have a customer service number. They have an automated support email that requires you to have the email, password, and phone number to your account to even submit an inquiry for help but if the person the person that hacked your account changed all that it’s impossible for them to help you. I reached out the same day my account was hacked 2 weeks ago and all I’ve gotten since is a email confirmation. I’ve heard nothing about it. I would advise you not to store your pictures in their memories system or to at least back them up because if you don’t like me you’ll lose years and years of photos and have no one to help you.

312,4,"Bottom line, Snapchat is a great app and is plenty of fun to talk to your friends and interact with people. They keep good updates going along, bud sadly, every time a major redesign happens or they add big new features, it’s usually something nobody likes. In fact it’s almost like Snapchat doesn’t really care about what the people want, just what they themselves like and kind of force the user to enjoy. If there’s one thing they everyone would love, it would be a Dark Mode capability. Considering every other major social media app has it, there’s no reason Snapchat can’t do it too. It’s something everyone wants, and nobody would cry about. It would probably look really good with the app too. It doesn’t even have to be a permanent thing obviously, just on and off. It can also adapt to the settings you have on your phone. So come on Snapchat, add Dark Mode.",12/28/20 6:57,0.1759848484848485,0.4498106060606061,positive

I am very upset because not only do I have various friends I’ve added throughout the years, but I will lose various saved messages and my MEMORIES. The fact that Snapchat is not doing the most they can to solve this issue makes me UPSET. I’ve contacted them several times but I guess they do not care for their users.

I tried resetting my password but since my account doesn’t exist, it can’t track my email nor my phone number. A possible solution would be to treat the account as a normal one for the 30 days it is being deleted. That way if the person decides to reactivate their account, it can be done so, but if they forgot , they can still get it. Snapchat services do not offer a toll free helpline, which isn’t beneficial for such a big company. My offer is that they update Snapchat where deactivated customers can still get their account back, without their password, and snapchat offers a helpline with actual technicians who can help. This would make snapchat a lot easier to handle and use, especially to those with problems handling technology.",12/1/19 15:31,0.043750000000000004,0.46041666666666664,trust

I have wifi and good service yet it still fails to post? I don’t get it. Also whenever I try to add a filter to my photo the app just bugs out and crashes and exits the app and I lose my video or picture which is very frustrating and annoying if I haven’t already saved it.

911,5,Oh my gosh I love this app! This app is one of my most used apps on my phone. I use it everyday to talk to my friends. I have had this app since about May and it is awesome! It has hilarious and cute filters plus you can take and send fun pictures to your friends. There are these things called streaks and it shows you how many days in a row you have snapped a person.

If you want to talk to your friends or keep up with people that you know, snapchat is really helpful because, chances are, most of the people you know have accounts. However, Snapchat seems to put out updates more often than other apps that change the layout of the app. Even thought you get used it after a while, it would be a cool feature if users were able to chose whether they received a new layout or not. Also, it would be really cool if there was an upcoming birthday feature that told you the birthdays in the upcoming week.",12/2/20 2:14,0.3222451790633609,0.4928374655647383,positive

I don’t understand how snapchat has continued to mess up it’s layout more and more, it might be my least favorite out of all the apps on my phone. I know Evan Spiegel got some kind of weird joy from making people upset with the last major layout redesign and I find that really bizarre. When the users of your platform collectively say “hey, we really like this app but this layout is incredibly confusing” and you try to turn that into some sort of character building thing like “stop complaining, you will adapt” or whatever, that’s kind of is a sucky move.",12/14/19 13:13,0.17632575757575758,0.5470117845117844,positive
949,1,"Snapchat is a cool app, however, if you ever decide you want to switch your photos from memories to photos you can't. It's the biggest pain. Snapchat allows you to select all from a month and transfer it to your photo library, but half the time it doesn't work because the app can't handle more than 100 photos. Secondly it deletes all the meta data 😭😭 if I had to guess it makes a whole new copy of the photo to save to your library instead of saving the original. It took me days to fix the meta data on my photos. For those of you who don't know, meta data is what tells your the date, time, and location your photo was taken. I'm not super picky about that stuff, but having photos from a few years back it'd be nice if they could at least keep the month and year.

Y’all should figure out away to be able to redo the phone number because I no longer have the number I started with and do to other issues I am opening a new acct so I can close my old one but can’t verify my new number because I’m guessing someone else once had it.

1592,1,"I updated from the iPhone X to the iPhone 12 Pro Max and saw a massive reduction in the quality of both the front facing and rear facing cameras when using Snapchat. The regular camera application is fine, even apps like Instagram, TIktok, and Facebook take great looking pictures on my new phone. But the pictures look extremely low quality on Snapchat, even lower quality than they did on my iPhone X. The pictures look low resolution with poor color rendering.

The iPhone 12 Pro Max has been out for over a month now and still this issue persists.

I suspect this is due to some sort of compression that Snapchat uses. It has gotten to be such an annoyance that I’ve just started using other social media apps more often instead of Snapchat. It’s unfortunate, because I used to love Snapchat. But if the main purpose of Snapchat is crippled with extremely poor photo quality, I’ll likely start using other apps. If the image quality is fixed, I might start using Snapchat more often again.

It would also be great to have an option to use the ultra-wide rear facing camera in Snapchat as well.",12/20/20 8:22,0.10354683195592287,0.5071122059758423,negative

So you have to post each section of a video to get the whole thing on your story which I don’t get how that is convenient. Another thing is exporting videos, the video saves weirdly a mix of the middle starts and then it has the rest of it.

2860,4,Snapchat is a great app! But lately it’s been very laggy and takes forever to send a text message or a snap. Also when it lags it doesn’t let me see my own text messages or the other person I’m texting. One other thing is that sometimes I’ll be stuck in a story like if I’m viewing friends snap story it would make stay there and it’s really annoying.

2862,1,Snapchat has locked me out of my account several times and even removed my account. I made a new one and it is still locking me out. I have gone in and tried to get help to try to make it so it didn’t happen again but Snapchat support does NOT help at all. It’s more like they don’t care. I have been a user of Snapchat for about 4 years now and the new updates have made it the worse app to communicate on. The new updates have made it impossible to even have the app. Snapchat has became a horrible app. I honestly just want to talk to my friends but Snapchat has locked me out of my account and won’t let me back in.,12/1/20 1:53,-0.05575757575757577,0.5363636363636364,trust

But let’s talk about the recent updates.

My main critique of Snapchat overall is the number of ads. There’s SO many on EVERY SINGLE STORY. Like there’s more ads than actual videos at this point. 😤 

There’s a bug with skipping ads as well. If you go back, sometimes it will put you back two videos before the ad and it’s SO annoying. 

And finally, I DO NOT LIKE THE SPOTLIGHT FEATURE. It’s essentially tik tok but with almost 0 customization so the videos are just completely random and irrelevant. I love tik tok and I do not need a second tik tok. Or if snap is going to be the next tik tok, at least give it something new that tik tok doesn’t have.",12/6/20 20:00,0.12896327810120917,0.4040976265114196,positive

I tried it with a few other words and got the same results. I’m very disappointed with this as it makes it almost impossible to find specific memories without looking through every one you have saved which is ridiculous.,12/22/19 8:46,-0.18484848484848487,0.531060606060606,negative

5256,2,People that I’m in a group chat with have started playing those games that were added a while back. What I’m wondering is why I receive a notification every time someone else plays a game. There’s no reason for that to happen. The main problem is that there’s no way to turn off these types of notifications. Your only option is to mute the group chat or turn off all notifications.

6247,1,I love Snapchat it’s such a fun app to get to know people and I like that it holds your photos but I’ve been having technical problems. My main account I’ve had since 2017 has been locked for a reason I do not know of. They didn’t send me any warnings or anything. I made 2 new accounts and they locked those too. Permanently. I soon realized that it was because of third party and when I deleted all of them. That’s when it locked out my second new account permanently. I don’t understand. If I make a new account I’ll just get permanently deleted.,12/9/20 22:37,0.13757575757575755,0.3096969696969697,trust
6248,2,Okay so I’m writing this review to hopefully get something out of it. My account was locked permanently for “spam” I was adding people back that had previously added me. My account had over 800 snaps. (i was gonna open them dw) The thing is I broke guidelines by making another account which also got permanently locked. I just dont understand why my account got locked in the first place. I cant even reach snapchat support. If someone could help me with this that would be fabulous.,12/3/20 18:59,0.1638888888888889,0.4166666666666667,trust

2. When adding to private story can you have it as a system where you say “swipe up” on a post to be added and it automatically does it, but the button after swiping up has to be “be added to private story” and like it automatically does it so it saves the embarrassment or awkwardness? The person can always delete them off if they want too, ya know?
